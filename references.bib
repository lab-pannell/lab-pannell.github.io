abstract = {Plant sexual dimorphism is thought to evolve in response to sex-specific selection associated with competition for access to mates or resources, both of which may be density dependent. In wind-pollinated plants in particular, vegetative traits such as plant size and architecture may influence resource acquisition and both pollen dispersal and receipt, with potential conflict between these two components of fitness. We evaluated the role of plant density in shaping plant traits by measuring evolutionary responses in experimental populations of the sexually dimorphic wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua. After three generations of evolution, we observed divergence between high- and low-density populations in several vegetative traits, whereas there was no divergence for reproductive traits. A reversal in the direction of sexually dimorphic traits expressed in young plants evolved in both low- and high-density populations compared to the original population (stored as seeds). Compared to the source population, males at high density evolved to be taller when young, whereas at low density young females tended to become smaller. These results demonstrate that a simple change in plant density can induce age-dependent and sex-specific evolution in the ontogeny of vegetative organs, and illustrates the power of experimental evolution for investigating plant trait evolution.},

abstract = {Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is a pore-forming protein that promotes pyroptosis and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent studies revealed that apoptotic caspase-8 directly cleaves GSDMD to trigger pyroptosis. However, the molecular requirements for caspase-8-dependent GSDMD cleavage and the physiological impact of this signaling axis are unresolved. Here, we report that caspase-8-dependent GSDMD cleavage confers susceptibility to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced lethality independently of caspase-1 and that GSDMD activation provides host defense against Yersinia infection. We further demonstrate that GSDMD inactivation by apoptotic caspases at aspartate 88 (D88) suppresses TNF-induced lethality but promotes anti-Yersinia defense. Last, we show that caspase-8 dimerization and autoprocessing are required for GSDMD cleavage, and provide evidence that the caspase-8 autoprocessing and activity on various complexes correlate with its ability to directly cleave GSDMD. These findings reveal GSDMD as a potential therapeutic target to reduce inflammation associated with mutations in the death receptor signaling machinery.},

abstract = {Tristyly is a genetic floral polymorphism in which three floral morphs are maintained at equal frequencies by negative frequency-dependent selection on alleles at two interacting loci. Because dominant alleles at these loci are maintained at a lower frequency than their recessive counterparts, they are more likely to be lost by founder events and genetic drift. Here we examine the hypothesis that dominant alleles under negative frequency-dependent selection should also be more likely to re-invade populations than recessive alleles, due to Haldane’s Sieve, because recessive alleles not expressed in a heterozygote state cannot benefit from positive selection when rare. We used computer simulations of tristylous metapopulations to verify that Haldane’s Sieve acting on migrants into occupied demes can indeed reverse the bias in allele frequencies expected for small single tristylous populations, particularly in situations of rapid population growth following colonisation. This effect is manifest both locally and at the metapopulation level. Our study illustrates the potential effect of Haldane’s Sieve in the novel context of an iconic plant sexual-system polymorphism under the influence of metapopulation dynamics.},

abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in morphology, physiology or life history traits is common in dioecious plants at reproductive maturity, but it is typically inconspicuous or absent in juveniles. Although plants of different sexes probably begin to diverge in gene expression both before their reproduction commences and before dimorphism becomes readily apparent, to our knowledge transcriptome-wide differential gene expression has yet to be demonstrated for any angiosperm species.
The present study documents differences in gene expression in both above- and below-ground tissues of early pre-reproductive individuals of the wind-pollinated dioecious annual herb, Mercurialis annua, which otherwise shows clear sexual dimorphism only at the adult stage.
Whereas males and females differed in their gene expression at the first leaf stage, sex-biased gene expression peaked just prior to, and after, flowering, as might be expected if sexual dimorphism is partly a response to differential costs of reproduction. Sex-biased genes were over-represented among putative sex-linked genes in M. annua but showed no evidence for more rapid evolution than unbiased genes.
Sex-biased gene expression in M. annua occurs as early as the first whorl of leaves is produced, is highly dynamic during plant development and varies substantially between vegetative tissues.},

abstract = {Plants with separate sexes often show “inconstant” or “leaky” sex expression, with females or males producing a few flowers of the opposite sex. The frequency and degree of such inconstancy may reflect residual hermaphroditic sex allocation after an evolutionary transition from combined to separate sexes. Sex inconstancy also represents a possible first step in the breakdown of dioecy back to hermaphroditism. In the Mercurialis annua (Euphorbiaceae) species complex, monoecy and androdioecy have evolved from dioecy in polyploid populations. Here, we characterize patterns of sex inconstancy in dioecious M. annua and discuss how sex inconstancy may have contributed to the breakdown of separate sexes in the genus.
We measured sex inconstancy in three common gardens of M. annua over 2 years using a modification of Lloyd’s phenotypic gender in terms of frequency and degree, with the degree calibrating inconstancy against the sex allocation of constant males and constant females, yielding a measure of gender that does not depend on the distribution of gender in the population.
Unusually for dioecious plants, the frequency of sex inconstancy in M. annua was greater in females, but its degree was greater for males in the 2 years of study. We suggest that this pattern is consistent with the maintenance of inconstancy in dioecious M. annua by selection for reproductive assurance under mate limitation.
Our study illustrates the utility of decomposing measures of sex inconstancy into its frequency and its degree and throws new light on the origin of variation in sexual systems in Mercurialis.},

abstract = {Sexual selection may contribute to the evolution of plant sexual dimorphism by favoring architectural traits in males that improve pollen dispersal to mates. In both sexes, larger individuals may be favored by allowing the allocation of more resources to gamete production (a “budget” effect of size). In wind-pollinated plants, large size may also benefit males by allowing the liberation of pollen from a greater height, fostering its dispersal (a “direct” effect of size). To assess these effects and their implications for trait selection, we measured selection on plant morphology in both males and females of the wind-pollinated dioecious herb Mercurialis annua in two separate experimental common gardens at contrasting density. In both gardens, selection strongly favored males that disperse their pollen further. Selection for pollen production was observed in the high-density garden only, and was weak. In addition, male morphologies associated with increased mean pollen dispersal differed between the two gardens, as elongated branches were favored in the high-density garden, whereas shorter plants with longer inflorescence stalks were favored in the low-density garden. Larger females were selected in both gardens. Our results point to the importance of both a direct effect of selection on male traits that affect pollen dispersal, and, to a lesser extent, a budget effect of selection on pollen production.},

abstract = {Dioecy has often broken down in flowering plants, yielding functional hermaphroditism. We reasoned that evolutionary transitions from dioecy to functional hermaphroditism must overcome an inertia of sexual dimorphism, because modified males or females will express the opposite sexual function for which their phenotypes have been optimised. We tested this prediction by assessing the siring success of monoecious individuals of the plant Mercurialis annua with an acquired male function but that are phenotypically still female-like. We found that pollen dispersed by female-like monoecious individuals was ~ 1/3 poorer at siring outcrossed offspring than pollen from monoecious individuals with an alternative male-like inflorescence. We conclude that whereas dioecy might evolve from functional hermaphroditism by conferring upon individuals certain benefits of sexual specialisation, reversion from a strategy of separate sexes to one of combined sexes must overcome constraints imposed by the advantages of sexual dimorphism. The breakdown of dioecy must therefore often be limited to situations in which outcrossing cannot be maintained and where selection favours a capacity for inbreeding by functional hermaphrodites.},

Attracting pollinators thus not only benefits individuals investing in advertising, but also other plants in a patch through a “magnet” effect. Accordingly, there could be an indirect fitness advantage to greater investment in costly floral displays by plants in kin-structured groups than when in groups of unrelated individuals. Here, we seek evidence for this strategy by manipulating relatedness in groups of the plant Moricandia moricandioides, an insect-pollinated herb that typically grows in patches. As predicted, individuals growing with kin, particularly at high density, produced larger floral displays than those growing with non-kin. Investment in attracting pollinators was thus moulded by the presence and relatedness of neighbours, exemplifying the importance of kin recognition in the evolution of plant reproductive strategies.},

The loss of SI may often lead to an increase in the selfing rate, with the purging of inbreeding depression and the ultimate evolution of a selfing syndrome, where plants have smaller flowers with reduced pollen and nectar production. In this study, we used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the timing of divergence between populations of the plant Linaria cavanillesii that differ in SI status and in which SI is associated with low inbreeding depression but not with a transition to full selfing or a selfing syndrome. Our analysis suggests that the mixed-mating self-compatible (SC) population may have begun to diverge from the SI populations around 2810 generation ago, a period perhaps too short for the evolution of a selfing syndrome. We conjecture that the SC population of L. cavanillesii is at an intermediate stage of transition between outcrossing and selfing.},

abstract = {Dimorphism in style height has evolved repeatedly in flowering plants, with some individuals having short and others long styles; in the case of distylous species, stigma position varies reciprocally with that of the anthers. Distyly can be associated with divergence in the functional gender between long- and short-styled individuals, but gender divergence has rarely been investigated in species with a simple stigma height polymorphism in the absence of reciprocal dimorphism in anther position. To evaluate the relation between stigma height polymorphism and gender, I measured the dimensions of floral morphology and seed production for the two morphs of a large population of the Iberian species Lithodora fruticosa (Boraginaceae). Results confirm the existence of a stigma height polymorphism in L. fruticosa, with long- and short-styled individuals at a 1:1 ratio in the studied population. Long-styled individuals produced substantially more seeds than did short-styled individuals, pointing to strong divergence in functional gender between the two morphs. The results of this study are puzzling in light of recent work that suggests that L. fruticosa has a multi-allelic self-incompatibility system. I discuss the significance of gender divergence in L. fruticosa and evaluate hypotheses that might explain it.

abstract = {Plants vary widely in the extent to which they defend themselves against herbivores. Because the resources available to plants are often site-specific, variation among sites dictates investment into defence and may reveal a growth-defence trade-off. Moreover, plants that have evolved different life-history strategies in different environments may situate themselves on this trade-off curve differently. For instance, plants that flower later have a longer vegetative life span and may accordingly defend themselves differently than those that flower earlier. Here, we tested whether late-flowering plants, with a longer vegetative life span, invest more in defence than early-flowering plants, using recombinant genotypes of the annual herb Cardamine hirsuta that differ in flowering time as a result of differences in the activity of the major floral repressor Flowering Locus C (FLC). We found that variation at FLC was mainly responsible for regulating flowering time and allocation to reproduction, but this partially depended on where the plants grew. We also found that variation at FLC mediated plant allocation to defence, with late-flowering plants producing higher levels of total glucosinolates and stress-related phytohormones. Nonetheless, plant growth and the qualitative values of plant defence and plant resistance against specialist herbivores were mainly independent from FLC.Synthesis. Our results highlight pleiotropic effects associated with flowering-time genes that might influence plant defence and plant-herbivore interactions.},

Persistence as adults and/or seeds across recruitment events allows species to dampen the effects of environmental fluctuations. The evolution of life cycles with overlapping generations should thus permit the colonization of environments with uncertain recruitment. We tested this hypothesis in Leucadendron (Proteaceae), a genus with high functional diversity native to fire-prone habitats in the South African fynbos. We analyzed the joint evolution of life-history traits (adult survival and seed-bank strategies) and ecological niches (climate and fire regime), using comparative methods and accounting for various sources of uncertainty. In the fynbos, species with canopy seed banks that are unable to survive fire as adults display nonoverlapping generations. In contrast, resprouters with an underground seed bank may be less threatened by extreme climatic events and fire intervals, given their iteroparity and long-lasting seed bank. Life cycles with nonoverlapping generations indeed jointly evolved with niches with less exposure to frost but not with those with less exposure to drought. Canopy seed banks jointly evolved with niches with more predictable fire return, compared to underground seed banks. The evolution of extraordinary functional diversity among fynbos plants thus reflects, at least in part, the diversity of both climates and fire regimes in this region.},

abstract = {Dioecious plants vary in whether their sex chromosomes are heteromorphic or homomorphic, but even homomorphic sex chromosomes may show divergence between homologues in the non-recombining, sex-determining region (SDR). Very little is known about the SDR of these species, which might represent particularly early stages of sex-chromosome evolution. Here, we assess the size and content of the SDR of the diploid dioecious herb  Mercurialis annua , a species with homomorphic sex chromosomes and mild Y-chromosome degeneration. We used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to identify new Y-linked markers for  M. annua.  Twelve of 24 transcripts showing male-specific expression in a previous experiment could be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) only from males, and are thus likely to be Y-linked. Analysis of genome-capture data from multiple populations of  M. annua  pointed to an additional six male-limited (and thus Y-linked) sequences. We used these markers to identify and sequence 17 sex-linked bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which form 11 groups of non-overlapping sequences, covering a total sequence length of about 1.5 Mb. Content analysis of this region suggests that it is enriched for repeats, has low gene density, and contains few candidate sex-determining genes.

abstract = {Neutral genetic diversity gradients have long been used to infer the colonization history of species [1, 2], but range expansion may also influence the efficacy of natural selection and patterns of non-synonymous polymorphism in different parts of a species’ range [3]. Recent theory predicts both an accumulation of deleterious mutations and a reduction in the efficacy of positive selection as a result of range expansion [4-8]. These signatures have been sought in a number of studies of the human range expansion out of Africa, but with contradictory results [9-14]. We analyzed the polymorphism patterns of 578,125 SNPs (17,648 genes) in the European diploid plant Mercurialis annua, which expanded its range from an eastern Mediterranean refugium into western habitats with contrasted climates [15]. Our results confirmed strong signatures of bottlenecks and revealed the accumulation of mildly to strongly deleterious mutations in range-front populations. A significantly higher number of these mutations were homozygous in individuals in range-front populations, pointing to increased genetic load and reduced fitness under a model of recessive deleterious effects. We also inferred a reduction in the number of selective sweeps in range-front versus core populations. These signatures have persisted even in a dioecious herb subject to substantial interpopulation gene flow [15]. Our results extend support from humans to plants for theory on the dynamics of mutations under selection during range expansion, showing that colonization bottlenecks can compromise adaptive potential.},

However, no molecular markers are yet available for genetic studies of its diploid populations. Here, we develop and characterize a set of eight polymorphic microsatellite markers for diploid dioecious M. annua.
Following an SSR-enrichment protocol, 13 microsatellite markers were proposed, eight of which yielded successful amplification and polymorphism. We screened the eight microsatellite loci in 100 individuals. The number of alleles per marker ranged from 6 to 12, and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.57 to 0.76. To estimate potential allele scoring errors, these individuals’ offspring were genotyped for the same loci, and error rates were estimated from parentage analyses. Error rates ranged from 0 to 6.8%. Cross-amplification tests were performed for congeneric M. huetti and M. canariensis, with successful amplification for seven and six of the eight loci, respectively. The novel microsatellite markers proposed here will be crucial for a multitude of genetic studies of M. annua and further establish its importance as a model species for addressing ecological and population genetic questions.},

abstract = {1. Plant demography is known to depend on both spatial dynamics and life history, but how these two factors interact is poorly understood. We conducted a longitudinal study of the wind-pollinated annual plant Mercurialis annua that varies geographically in its sexual system to investigate this interaction. 

2. Metapopulation demographic models predict that regular population turnover should be a more common feature of monomorphic than dimorphic populations because males and females cannot found new populations by selfing but hermaphrodites can. We tested the prediction that rates of population turnover would be higher in monomorphic compared to dimorphic regions. 

3. We surveyed 356 populations of M. annua along five regional transects in Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula over a 3-year period to examine their demography and persistence. Each transect crossed a transition in the sexual system, from a monomorphic region where almost all populations were hermaphroditic to a dimorphic one in which most populations had separate sexes (males with females or hermaphrodites). 

4. As predicted, rates of local apparent extinctions (i.e., the disappearance of adult plants) were nearly 50% higher in monomorphic compared to dimorphic regions. Local extinctions appeared to be driven by changes in vegetation cover, with extinctions tending to occur in sites in which perennial cover also declined. This suggests that disturbance is a primary agent of local extinctions. 

5. We further examined the influence of regional dynamics on local demographic properties by investigating patterns of spatial autocorrelation in population density across years. We found positive spatial autocorrelations in plant densities within regions for both sexual systems. However, these positive autocorrelations extended over shorter distances in monomorphic regions, perhaps as a result of greater population flux in these regions. 

6. Synthesis. Our study shows that population dynamics may be influenced by processes acting at a range of spatial scales: within patches, across patches within sites, and across sites within regions, as well as by life-history variation. In Mercurialis annua, regional variation in apparent extinction rates is affected by life history and implicated in regulating the geographical distribution of populations with different sexual systems.},

abstract = {Because establishing a new population often depends critically on finding mates, individuals capable of uniparental reproduction may have a colonization advantage. Accordingly, there should be an over-representation of colonizing species in which individuals can reproduce without a mate, particularly in isolated locales such as oceanic islands. Despite the intuitive appeal of this colonization filter hypothesis (known as Baker’s law), more than six decades of analyses have yielded mixed findings. We assembled a dataset of island and mainland plant breeding systems, focusing on the presence or absence of self-incompatibility. Because this trait enforces outcrossing and is unlikely to re-evolve on short timescales if it is lost, breeding system is especially likely to reflect the colonization filter. We found significantly more self-compatible species on islands than mainlands across a sample of &gt; 1500 species from three widely distributed flowering plant families (Asteraceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae). Overall, 66% of island species were self-compatible, compared with 41% of mainland species. Our results demonstrate that the presence or absence of self-incompatibility has strong explanatory power for plant geographical patterns. Island floras around the world thus reflect the role of a key reproductive trait in filtering potential colonizing species in these three plant families.

abstract = {Dioecy, the coexistence of separate male and female individuals in a population, is a rare but phylogenetically widespread sexual system in flowering plants. While research has concentrated on why and how dioecy evolves from hermaphroditism, the question of why dioecy is rare, despite repeated transitions to it, has received much less attention. Previous phylogenetic and theoretical studies have suggested that dioecy might be an evolutionary dead end. However, recent research indicates that the phylogenetic support for this hypothesis is attributable to a methodological bias and that there is no evidence for reduced diversification in dioecious angiosperms. The relative rarity of dioecy thus remains a puzzle. Here, we review evidence for the hypothesis that dioecy might be rare not because it is an evolutionary dead end, but rather because it easily reverts to hermaphroditism. We review what is known about transitions between hermaphroditism and dioecy, and conclude that there is an important need to consider more widely the possibility of transitions away from dioecy, both from an empirical and a theoretical point of view, and by combining tools from molecular evolution and insights from ecology.

abstract = {1. Low pollination intensity may cause low seed set in plant populations and is thought to be responsible for evolutionary transitions from outcrossing to selfing, or from animal to wind pollination. Variation in pollination intensity may also affect seed quality both through its influence on the degree of pollen competition (with lower quality offspring produced under low pollen intensities) and through seed size-number trade-offs (with plants under low pollination intensity producing fewer but larger seeds).

2. Here, we use a field experiment to examine the effects of pollination intensity on both quantity and quality of progeny. We manipulated pollen receipt to stigmas of the wind-pollinated dioecious plant Mercurialis annua by varying the distance of females from males. We then compared seed size and number, seedling growth and allocation to male and female function, for the progeny produced by females subjected to different pollination intensities.

3. Our experiment revealed a reduction in pollen load with increasing distance to males, translating into large reductions in the number of seeds produced but only small effects on the performance of offspring. The main effect on offspring quality was through a seed size-number trade-off, with pollen-limited females producing fewer but larger seeds, which subsequently performed better. Sons and daughters were affected differently by this trade-off, pointing to gender-dependent effects of pollination intensity on progeny performance.

4. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of pollination intensity on both the quantity and quality of progeny. Nevertheless, fitness calculations suggest that the enhanced quality of seed produced by pollen-limited mothers was not sufficient to offset their losses in terms of quantity.},

abstract = {Serotiny is an important adaptation for plants in fire-prone environments. However, different mechanisms also induce the opening of serotinous cones in the absence of fire in variably serotinous species. Xeriscence -cone opening driven by dry and hot conditions- is considered to be mediated only by the external environment, but endogenous factors could also play a significant role. Using the variably serotinous Pinus halepensis as our model species, we determined the effects of cone age and scales density in cone opening, and using in-situ and ex-situ manipulative experiments we investigated the role of water availability in the opening of serotinous cones. We hypothesized that loss of connection between the cones and the branch through the peduncles or the absence of water supply could induce a faster cone opening. Results showed that older cones lost more water and opened at lower temperatures, with no influence of scales density. Both field and chamber manipulative experiments (using paired cones of the same whorl) confirmed that water intake through the peduncles affected significantly the pace of cone opening, such that lack of water supply speeded up cone dehiscence. However, this was true for weakly serotinous provenances-more common in this species-, while highly serotinous provenances were indifferent to this effect in the field test. All our results support that cone serotiny in P. halepensis involves the allocation of water to the cones, which is highly consistent with the previously observed environmental effects. Importantly, the existence of maintenance costs of serotinous cones has strong implications on the effects of climate change in the resilience of natural populations, via modifications of the canopy seed banks and recruitment after stand-replacing fires. Moreover, evolutionary models for serotiny in P. halepensis must take into account the significant contribution of maintenance costs to the complex interaction between genotype and the environment.

abstract = {Sex determination is as important for the fitness of plants as it is for animals, but its mechanisms appear to vary much more among plants than among animals, and the expression of gender in plants differs in important respects from that in most animals. In this Minireview, I provide an overview of the broad variety of ways in which plants determine sex. I suggest that several important peculiarities of plant sex determination can be understood by recognising that: plants show an alternation of generations between sporophytic and gametophytic phases (either of which may take control of sex determination); plants are modular in structure and lack a germ line (allowing for a quantitative expression of gender that is not common in animals); and separate sexes in plants have ultimately evolved from hermaphroditic ancestors. Most theorising about sex determination in plants has focused on dioecious species, but we have much to learn from monecious or hermaphroditic species, where sex is determined at the level of modules, tissues or cells. Because of the fundamental modularity of plant development and potentially important evolutionary links between monoecy and dioecy, it may be useful to relax the distinction often made between “developmental sex determination” (which underpins the development of male versus female flowers in monoecious species) and “genetic sex determination” (which underpins the separation of males and females in dioecious species, often mediated by a genetic polymorphism and sex chromosomes). I also argue for relaxing the distinction between sex determination involving a genetic polymorphism and that involving responses to environmental or hormonal cues, because non-genetic cues might easily be converted into genetic switches.

One such trait is a plant’s sex allocation (or gender), which influences its reproductive success directly as a function of the potentially heterogeneous mating prospects in the population. However, it is unknown how polyploidy per se might affect plasticity in a plant’s sex allocation. Although there have been numerous comparisons between diploid and (usually) tetraploid taxa, we know very little about how elevated ploidy above the diploid level might affect plasticity. Here, we ask whether different ploidy levels &gt; 2x express different plasticity in the ruderal plant Mercurialis annua. We grew tetraploid and hexaploid hermaphrodites under different levels of nutrient availability and compared their reaction norms for growth (above-ground biomass, SLA) and reproductive traits (reproductive effort, phenotypic gender). Overall, we found that an increase in ploidy level from 4x to 6x in M. annua is associated with an increase in the relative biomass allocated to seeds, measured as female reproductive effort. However, our study provides no support for the idea that increasing ploidy level increases the ability to express different phenotypes in response to changes in the environment.

abstract = {The differential plasticity hypothesis suggests that sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants could evolve in response to sex-specific resource requirements for reproduction (i.e., high carbon requirements for ovules and high nitrogen demands for pollen). When resources become limiting during growth, males and females should, therefore, adjust their allocation to resource-harvesting organs differently. To investigate the potential for plants to respond to resource limitation late in life and to test the differential plasticity hypothesis, we grew male and female individuals of the annual wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua in a common garden. Late in the growth season, we simulated a change in competition by decreasing plant density in half of the replicates. We measured both allocation to vegetative and reproductive traits and analyzed the relative allocation to reproduction vs. growth. Males and females differentially adjusted their resource allocation in response to varying plant densities, despite the fact that they were reproductively mature. Males maintained the same relative allocation of resource to reproductive vs. vegetative tissues at both densities. In contrast, females reduced vegetative growth proportionally less than seed production at the higher density. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of allocation decisions taken by plants, which respond quickly and in a sexually dimorphic way to changes in their competitive circumstances. The existence of resource “currencies” limiting male and female functions differently have potentially led to the evolution of sex-specific strategies of resource acquisition and deployment, with females conserving resources for vegetative organs to ensure their future carbon-rich reproduction.},

abstract = {High inbreeding depression is thought to be one of the major factors preventing evolutionary transitions in hermaphroditic plants from self-incompatibility (SI) and outcrossing toward self-compatibility (SC) and selfing. However, when selfing does evolve, inbreeding depression can be quickly purged, allowing the evolution of complete self-fertilization. In contrast, populations that show intermediate selfing rates (a mixed-mating system) typically show levels of inbreeding depression similar to those in outcrossing species, suggesting that selection against inbreeding might be responsible for preventing the transition toward complete self-fertilization. By implication, crosses among populations should reveal patterns of heterosis for mixed-mating populations that are similar to those expected for outcrossing populations. Using hand-pollination crosses, we compared levels of inbreeding depression and heterosis between populations of Linaria cavanillesii (Plantaginaceae), a perennial herb showing contrasting mating systems. The SI population showed high inbreeding depression, whereas the SC population displaying mixed mating showed no inbreeding depression. In contrast, we found that heterosis based on between-population crosses was similar for SI and SC populations. Our results are consistent with the rapid purging of inbreeding depression in the derived SC population, despite the persistence of mixed mating. However, the maintenance of outcrossing after a transition to SC is inconsistent with the prediction that populations that have purged their inbreeding depression should evolve toward complete selfing, suggesting that the transition to SC in L. cavanillesii has been recent. SC in L. cavanillesii thus exemplifies a situation in which the mating system is likely not at an equilibrium with inbreeding depression.

abstract = {Many hermaphroditic plants avoid self-fertilization by means of a molecular self-incompatibility (SI) system, a complex trait that is difficult to evolve but relatively easy to lose. Loss of SI is a prerequisite for an evolutionary transition from obligate outcrossing to self-fertilization, which may bring about rapid changes in the genetic diversity and structure of populations. Loss of SI is also often followed by the evolution of a “selfing syndrome”, with plants having small flowers, little nectar and few pollen grains per ovule. Here, we document the loss of SI in the long-lived Spanish toadflax Linaria cavanillesii, which has led to mixed mating rather than a transition to a high rate of selfing and in which an outcrossing syndrome has been maintained.
We performed crosses within and among six populations of L. cavanillesii in the glasshouse, measured floral traits in a common-garden experiment, performed a pollen-limitation experiment in the field and conducted population genetic analyses using microsatellites markers.
Controlled crosses revealed variation in SI from fully SI through intermediate SI to fully self-compatible (SC). Flowers of SC individuals showed no evidence of a selfing syndrome. Although the SC population of L. cavanillesii had lower within-population genetic diversity than SI populations, as expected, population differentiation among all populations was extreme and represents an FST outlier in the distribution for both selfing and outcrossing species of flowering plants.
Together, our results suggest that the transition to SC in L. cavanillesii has probably been very recent, and may have been aided by selection during or following a colonization bottleneck rather than in the absence of pollinators. We find little indication that the transition to SC has been driven by selection for reproductive assurance under conditions currently prevailing in natural populations.

abstract = {Speciation results from the progressive accumulation of mutations that decrease the probability of mating between parental populations or reduce the fitness of hybrids-the so-called species barriers. The speciation genomic literature, however, is mainly a collection of case studies, each with its own approach and specificities, such that a global view of the gradual process of evolution from one to two species is currently lacking. Of primary importance is the prevalence of gene flow between diverging entities, which is central in most species concepts and has been widely discussed in recent years. Here, we explore the continuum of speciation thanks to a comparative analysis of genomic data from 61 pairs of populations/species of animals with variable levels of divergence. Gene flow between diverging gene pools is assessed under an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. We show that the intermediate “grey zone” of speciation, in which taxonomy is often controversial, spans from 0.5% to 2% of net synonymous divergence, irrespective of species life history traits or ecology. Thanks to appropriate modeling of among-locus variation in genetic drift and introgression rate, we clarify the status of the majority of ambiguous cases and uncover a number of cryptic species. Our analysis also reveals the high incidence in animals of semi-isolated species (when some but not all loci are affected by barriers to gene flow) and highlights the intrinsic difficulty, both statistical and conceptual, of delineating species in the grey zone of speciation.

abstract = {In flowering plants, many dioecious species display a certain degree of sexual dimorphism in non-reproductive traits, but this dimorphism tends to be much less striking than that found in animals. Sexual size dimorphism in plants may be limited because competition for light in crowded environments so strongly penalises small plants. The idea that competition for light constrains the evolution of strong sexual size dimorphism in plants (the size-constraint hypothesis) implies a strong dependency of the expression of sexual size dimorphism on the neighbouring density as a result of the capacity of plants to adjust their reproductive effort and investment in growth in response to their local environment. Here, we tested this hypothesis by experimentally altering the context of competition for light among male-female pairs of the light-demanding dioecious annual plant Mercurialis annua. We found that males were smaller than females across all treatments, but sexual size dimorphism was diminished for pairs grown at higher densities. This result is consistent with the size-constraint hypothesis. We discuss our results in terms of the tension between selection on size acting in opposite directions on males and females, which have different optima under sexual selection, and stabilizing selection for similar sizes in males and females, which have similar optima under viability selection for plasticity in size expression under different density conditions.

abstract = {Postmating but prezygotic (PMPZ) interactions are increasingly recognized as a potentially important early-stage barrier in the evolution of reproductive isolation. A recent study described a potential example between populations of the same species: single matings between Drosophila montana populations resulted in differential fertilisation success because of the inability of sperm from one population (Vancouver) to penetrate the eggs of the other population (Colorado). As the natural mating system of D. montana is polyandrous (females remate rapidly), we set up double matings of all possible crosses between the same populations to test whether competitive effects between ejaculates influence this PMPZ isolation. We measured premating isolation in no-choice tests, female fecundity, fertility and egg-to-adult viability after single and double matings as well as second-male paternity success (P-2). Surprisingly, we found no PMPZ reproductive isolation between the two populations under a competitive setting, indicating no difficulty of sperm from Vancouver males to fertilize Colorado eggs after double matings. While there were subtle differences in how P-2 changed over time, suggesting that Vancouver males’ sperm are somewhat less competitive in a first-male role within Colorado females, these effects did not translate into differences in overall P-2. Fertilisation success can thus differ dramatically between competitive and noncompetitive conditions, perhaps because the males that mate second produce higher quality ejaculates in response to sperm competition. We suggest that unlike in more divergent species comparisons, where sperm competition typically increases reproductive isolation, ejaculate tailoring can reduce the potential for PMPZ isolation when recently diverged populations interbreed.},

However, the current phylogeny is not yet well supported, and relationships among subfamilies and tribes of Ranunculaceae remain an open question. Eight molecular markers from the three genomes (nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial) were selected to investigate these relationships, including new markers for the family (two homologs of the nuclear CYCLOIDEA gene, the chloroplast gene ndhF, and the mitochondrial intron nad4-I1). The combination of multiple markers led to better resolution and higher support of phylogenetic relationships among subfamilies of Ranunculaceae, and among tribes within subfamily Ranunculoideae. Our results challenge the monophyly of Ranunculoideae as currently circumscribed due to the position of tribe Adonideae (Ranunculoideae), sister to Thalictroideae. We suggest that Thalictroideae could be merged with Ranunculoideae in an enlarged single subfamily.},

Here, we test the performance of a single transcriptome to understand whether it can provide a cost-efficient resource for species with large unknown genomes. Using RNA from six different tissues from a single Palearctic green toad (Bufo viridis) specimen and Hiseq2000, we obtained 22,5 Mio reads and publish &gt;100,000 unigene sequences. To evaluate efficacy and quality, we first use this data to identify green toad specific candidate genes, known from other vertebrates for their role in sex determination and differentiation. Of a list of 37 genes, the transcriptome yielded 32 (87%), many of which providing the first such data for this non-model anuran species. However, for many of these genes, only fragments could be retrieved. In order to allow also applications to population genetics, we further used the transcriptome for the targeted development of 21 non-anonymous microsatellites and tested them in genetic families and backcrosses. Eleven markers were specifically developed to be located on the B. viridis sex chromosomes; for eight markers we can indeed demonstrate sex-specific transmission in genetic families. Depending on phylogenetic distance, several markers, which are sex-linked in green toads, show high cross-amplification success across the anuran phylogeny, involving nine systematic anuran families. Our data support the view that single transcriptome sequencing (based on multiple tissues) provides a reliable genomic resource and cost-efficient method for non-model amphibian species with large genome size and, despite limitations, should be considered as long as genome sequencing remains unaffordable for most species.},

abstract = {Chromosome number changes during the evolution of angiosperms are likely to have played a major role in speciation. Their study is of utmost importance, especially now, as a probabilistic model is available to study chromosome evolution within a phylogenetic framework. In the present study, likelihood models of chromosome number evolution were fitted to the largest family of flowering plants, the Asteraceae. Specifically, a phylogenetic supertree of this family was used to reconstruct the ancestral chromosome number and infer genomic events. Our approach inferred that the ancestral chromosome number of the family is n = 9. Also, according to the model that best explained our data, the evolution of haploid chromosome numbers in Asteraceae was a very dynamic process, with genome duplications and descending dysploidy being the most frequent genomic events in the evolution of this family. This model inferred more than one hundred whole genome duplication events; however, it did not find evidence for a paleopolyploidization at the base of this family, which has previously been hypothesized on the basis of sequence data from a limited number of species. The obtained results and potential causes of these discrepancies are discussed.

abstract = {We advocate the advantage of an evolutionary approach to conservation biology that considers evolutionary history at various levels of biological organization. We review work on three separate plant taxa, spanning from one to multiple decades, illustrating extremes in metapopulation functioning. We show how the rare endemics Centaurea corymbosa (Clape Massif, France) and Brassica insularis in Corsica (France) may be caught in an evolutionary trap: disruption of metapopulation functioning due to lack of colonization of new sites may have counterselected traits such as dispersal ability or self-compatibility, making these species particularly vulnerable to any disturbance. The third case study concerns the evolution of life history strategies in the highly diverse genus Leucadendron of the South African fynbos. There, fire disturbance and the recolonization phase after fires are so integral to the functioning of populations that recruitment of new individuals is conditioned by fire. We show how past adaptation to different fire regimes and climatic constraints make species with different life history syndromes more or less vulnerable to global changes. These different case studies suggest that management strategies should promote evolutionary potential and evolutionary processes to better protect extant biodiversity and biodiversification.},

Despite that, genetic information is largely neglected in conservation planning, and how conservation units should be defined is still heatedly debated. Here, we use maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), an outcrossing long-lived tree with a highly fragmented distribution in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, to prove the importance of accounting for genetic variation, of both neutral molecular markers and quantitative traits, to define useful conservation units. Six gene pools associated to distinct evolutionary histories were identified within the species using 12 microsatellites and 266 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, height and survival standing variation, their genetic control, and plasticity were assessed in a multisite clonal common garden experiment (16 544 trees). We found high levels of quantitative genetic differentiation within previously defined neutral gene pools. Subsequent cluster analysis and post hoc trait distribution comparisons allowed us to define 10 genetically homogeneous population groups with high evolutionary potential. They constitute the minimum number of units to be represented in a maritime pine dynamic conservation program. Our results uphold that the identification of conservation units below the species level should account for key neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity, especially in species with strong population structure and complex evolutionary histories. The environmental zonation approach currently used by the pan-European genetic conservation strategy for forest trees would be largely improved by gradually integrating molecular and quantitative trait information, as data become available.},

The European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and brook lamprey (L. planeri) show a low reproductive isolation but have highly distinct life histories, the former being parasitic-anadromous and the latter non-parasitic and freshwater resident. Here we used microsatellite data from six replicated population pairs to reconstruct their history of divergence using an approximate Bayesian computation framework combined with a random forest model. In most population pairs, scenarios of divergence with recent isolation were outcompeted by scenarios proposing ongoing gene flow, namely the Secondary Contact (SC) and Isolation with Migration (IM) models. The estimation of demographic parameters under the SC model indicated a time of secondary contact close to the time of speciation, explaining why SC and IM models could not be discriminated. In case of an ancient secondary contact, the historical signal of divergence is lost and neutral markers converge to the same equilibrium as under the less parameterized model allowing ongoing gene flow. Our results imply that models of secondary contacts should be systematically compared to models of divergence with gene flow; given the difficulty to discriminate among these models, we suggest that genome-wide data are needed to adequately reconstruct divergence history.},

abstract = {Understanding adaptive genetic responses to climate change is a main challenge for preserving biological diversity. Successful predictive models for climate-driven range shifts of species depend on the integration of information on adaptation, including that derived from genomic studies. Long-lived forest trees can experience substantial environmental change across generations, which results in a much more prominent adaptation lag than in annual species. Here, we show that candidate-gene SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) can be used as predictors of maladaptation to climate in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), an outcrossing long-lived keystone tree. A set of 18 SNPs potentially associated with climate, 5 of them involving amino acid-changing variants, were retained after performing logistic regression, latent factor mixed models, and Bayesian analyses of SNP-climate correlations. These relationships identified temperature as an important adaptive driver in maritime pine and highlighted that selective forces are operating differentially in geographically discrete gene pools. The frequency of the locally advantageous alleles at these selected loci was strongly correlated with survival in a common garden under extreme (hot and dry) climate conditions, which suggests that candidate-gene SNPs can be used to forecast the likely destiny of natural forest ecosystems under climate change scenarios. Differential levels of forest decline are anticipated for distinct maritime pine gene pools. Geographically defined molecular proxies for climate adaptation will thus critically enhance the predictive power of range-shift models and help establish mitigation measures for long-lived keystone forest trees in the face of impending climate change.},

abstract = {Colonization is likely to be more successful for species with an ability to self-fertilize and thus to establish new populations as single individuals. As a result, self-compatibility should be common among colonizing species. This idea, labelled “Baker’s law”, has been influential in discussions of sexual-system and mating-system evolution. However, its generality has been questioned, because models of the evolution of dispersal and the mating system predict an association between high dispersal rates and outcrossing rather than selfing, and because of many apparent counter examples to the law. The contrasting predictions made by models invoking Baker’s law versus those for the evolution of the mating system and dispersal urges a reassessment of how we should view both these traits. Here, I review the literature on the evolution of mating and dispersal in colonizing species, with a focus on conceptual issues. I argue for the importance of distinguishing between the selfing or outcrossing rate and a simple ability to self-fertilize, as well as for the need for a more nuanced consideration of dispersal. Colonizing species will be characterized by different phases in their life pattern: dispersal to new habitat, implying an ecological sieve on dispersal traits; establishment and a phase of growth following colonization, implying a sieve on reproductive traits; and a phase of demographic stasis at high density, during which new trait associations can evolve through local adaptation. This dynamic means that the sorting of mating-system and dispersal traits should change over time, making simple predictions difficult.},

abstract = {Baker’s law refers to the tendency for species that establish on islands by long-distance dispersal to show an increased capacity for self-fertilization because of the advantage of self-compatibility when colonizing new habitat. Despite its intuitive appeal and broad empirical support, it has received substantial criticism over the years since it was proclaimed in the 1950s, not least because it seemed to be contradicted by the high frequency of dioecy on islands. Recent theoretical work has again questioned the generality and scope of Baker’s law. Here, we attempt to discern where the idea is useful to apply and where it is not. We conclude that several of the perceived problems with Baker’s law fall away when a narrower perspective is adopted on how it should be circumscribed. We emphasize that Baker’s law should be read in terms of an enrichment of a capacity for uniparental reproduction in colonizing situations, rather than of high selfing rates. We suggest that Baker’s law might be tested in four different contexts, which set the breadth of its scope: the colonization of oceanic islands, metapopulation dynamics with recurrent colonization, range expansions with recurrent colonization, and colonization through species invasions.},

abstract = {Many eukaryote organisms are polyploid. However, despite their importance, evolutionary inference of polyploid origins and modes of inheritance has been limited by a need for analyses of allele segregation at multiple loci using crosses. The increasing availability of sequence data for nonmodel species now allows the application of established approaches for the analysis of genomic data in polyploids. Here, we ask whether approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), applied to realistic traditional and next-generation sequence data, allows correct inference of the evolutionary and demographic history of polyploids. Using simulations, we evaluate the robustness of evolutionary inference by ABC for tetraploid species as a function of the number of individuals and loci sampled, and the presence or absence of an outgroup. We find that ABC adequately retrieves the recent evolutionary history of polyploid species on the basis of both old and new sequencing technologies. The application of ABC to sequence data from diploid and polyploid species of the plant genus Capsella confirms its utility. Our analysis strongly supports an allopolyploid origin of C. bursa-pastoris about 80 000 years ago. This conclusion runs contrary to previous findings based on the same data set but using an alternative approach and is in agreement with recent findings based on whole-genome sequencing. Our results indicate that ABC is a promising and powerful method for revealing the evolution of polyploid species, without the need to attribute alleles to a homeologous chromosome pair. The approach can readily be extended to more complex scenarios involving higher ploidy levels.},

abstract = {Separate sexes have evolved on numerous independent occasions from hermaphroditic ancestors in flowering plants. The mechanisms of sex determination is known for only a handful of such species, but, in those that have been investigated, it usually involves alleles segregating at a single locus, sometimes on heteromorphic sex chromosomes. In the genus Mercurialis, transitions between combined (hermaphroditism) and separate sexes (dioecy or androdioecy, where males co-occur with hermaphrodites rather than females) have occurred more than once in association with hybridisation and shifts in ploidy. Previous work has pointed to an unusual 3-locus system of sex determination in dioecious populations. Here, we use crosses and genotyping for a sex-linked marker to reject this model: sex in diploid dioecious M. annua is determined at a single locus with a dominant male-determining allele (an XY system). We also crossed individuals among lineages of Mercurialis that differ in their ploidy and sexual system to ascertain the extent to which the same sex-determination system has been conserved following genome duplication, hybridisation and transitions between dioecy and hermaphroditism. Our results indicate that the male-determining element is fully capable of determining gender in the progeny of hybrids between different lineages. Specifically, males crossed with females or hermaphrodites always generate 1:1 male:female or male:hermaphrodite sex ratios, respectively, regardless of the ploidy levels involved (diploid, tetraploid or hexaploid). Our results throw further light on the genetics of the remarkable variation in sexual systems in the genus Mercurialis. They also illustrate the almost identical expression of sex-determining alleles in terms of sexual phenotypes across multiple divergent backgrounds, including those that have lost separate sexes altogether.},

abstract = {Compared to natural selection, domestication implies a dramatic change in traits linked to fitness. A number of traits conferring fitness in the wild might be detrimental under domestication, and domesticated species typically differ from their ancestors in a set of traits known as the domestication syndrome. Specifically, trade-offs between growth and reproduction are well established across the tree of life. According to allocation theory, selection for growth rate is expected to indirectly alter life-history reproductive traits, diverting resources from reproduction to growth. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the genetic change and correlated responses of reproductive traits as a result of selection for timber yield in the tree Pinus pinaster. Phenotypic selection was carried out in a natural population, and progenies from selected trees were compared with those of control trees in a common garden experiment. According to expectations, we detected a genetic change in important life-history traits due to selection. Specifically, threshold sizes for reproduction were much higher and reproductive investment relative to size significantly lower in the selected progenies just after a single artificial selection event. Our study helps to define the domestication syndrome in exploited forest trees and shows that changes affecting developmental pathways are relevant in domestication processes of long-lived plants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The coexistence of hermaphrodites and female-sterile individuals, or androdioecy, has been documented in only a handful of plants and animals. This study reports its existence in the plant species Cardamine amara (Brassicaceae), in which female-sterile individuals have shorter pistils than seed-producing hermaphrodites.
METHODS: Morphological analysis, in situ manual pollination, microsatellite genotyping and differential gene expression analysis using Arabidopsis microarrays were used to delimit variation between female-sterile individuals and hermaphrodites.
KEY RESULTS: Female sterility in C. amara appears to be caused by disrupted ovule development. It was associated with a 2.4- to 2.9-fold increase in clonal propagation. This made the pollen number of female-sterile genets more than double that of hermaphrodite genets, which fulfils a condition of co-existence predicted by simple androdioecy theories. When female-sterile individuals were observed in wild androdioecious populations, their ramet frequencies ranged from 5 to 54 %; however, their genet frequencies ranged from 11 to 29 %, which is consistent with the theoretically predicted upper limit of 50 %.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a combination of sexual reproduction and increased asexual proliferation by female-sterile individuals probably explains the invasion and maintenance of female sterility in otherwise hermaphroditic populations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the coexistence of female sterility and hermaphrodites in the Brassicaceae.},
