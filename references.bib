abstract = {Floral stalk height is known to affect seed dispersal of wind-dispersed grassland species, but it may also affect the attractiveness of flowers and fruits of animal-pollinated and animal-dispersed plants. Stalk height may thus be responsive to selection via interactions with both mutualist pollinators and seed dispersers, but also antagonist florivores and seed predators. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of pollinators and seed predators on selection on floral stalk height in the insect-pollinated and wind-dispersed, alpine, andromonoecious herb Pulsatilla alpina, whose flowers also vary in their sex allocation and thus in the resources available to both mutualists and antagonists.
We measured the resource status of individuals in terms of their size and the height of the vegetation surrounding plants of P. alpina at 11 sites. In one population, we recorded floral stalk height over an entire growing season and investigated its association with floral morphology and floral sex allocation (pistil and stamen number) and used leaf-removal manipulations to assess the effect of herbivory on floral stalk height. Finally, in four populations, we quantified phenotypic selection on floral stalk height in four female components of reproductive success before seed dispersal.
Stalk height was positively associated with female allocation of the respective flower, the resource status of the individual, and the height of the surrounding vegetation, and negatively affected by leaf removal. Our results point to disruptive selection on stalk height in terms of both selection differentials and selection gradients for fertilization, seed predation, and seed maturation rates and to positive selection on stalk height in terms of a selection differential for mature seed number.
Stalk height of P. alpina is a costly trait that affects female reproductive success via interactions with both mutualists and antagonists. We discuss the interplay between the resource status and selection imposed on female reproductive success and its likely role in the evolution of sex-allocation strategies, especially andromonoecy.},

abstract = {Plant sexual dimorphism is thought to evolve in response to sex-specific selection associated with competition for access to mates or resources, both of which may be density dependent. In wind-pollinated plants in particular, vegetative traits such as plant size and architecture may influence resource acquisition and both pollen dispersal and receipt, with potential conflict between these two components of fitness. We evaluated the role of plant density in shaping plant traits by measuring evolutionary responses in experimental populations of the sexually dimorphic wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua. After three generations of evolution, we observed divergence between high- and low-density populations in several vegetative traits, whereas there was no divergence for reproductive traits. A reversal in the direction of sexually dimorphic traits expressed in young plants evolved in both low- and high-density populations compared to the original population (stored as seeds). Compared to the source population, males at high density evolved to be taller when young, whereas at low density young females tended to become smaller. These results demonstrate that a simple change in plant density can induce age-dependent and sex-specific evolution in the ontogeny of vegetative organs, and illustrates the power of experimental evolution for investigating plant trait evolution.},

abstract = {Polyploidization may precipitate dramatic changes to the genome, including chromosome rearrangements, gene loss, and changes in gene expression. In dioecious plants, the sex-determining mechanism may also be disrupted by polyploidization, with the potential evolution of hermaphroditism. However, while dioecy appears to have persisted through a ploidy transition in some species, it is unknown whether the newly formed polyploid maintained its sex-determining system uninterrupted, or whether dioecy re-evolved after a period of hermaphroditism. Here, we develop a bioinformatic pipeline using RNA-sequencing data from natural populations to demonstrate that the allopolyploid plant Mercurialis canariensis directly inherited its sex-determining region from one of its diploid progenitor species, M. annua, and likely remained dioecious through the transition. The sex-determining region of M. canariensis is smaller than that of its diploid progenitor, suggesting that the non-recombining region of M. annua expanded subsequent to the polyploid origin of M. canariensis. Homeologous pairs show partial sexual subfunctionalization. We discuss the possibility that gene duplicates created by polyploidization might contribute to resolving sexual antagonism.},

abstract = {Differences between males and females are usually more subtle in dioecious plants than animals, but strong sexual dimorphism has evolved convergently in the South African Cape plant genus Leucadendron. Such sexual dimorphism in leaf size is expected largely to be due to differential gene expression between the sexes. We compared patterns of gene expression in leaves among 10 Leucadendron species across the genus. Surprisingly, we found no positive association between sexual dimorphism in morphology and the number or the percentage of sex-biased genes (SBGs). Sex bias in most SBGs evolved recently and was species specific. We compared rates of evolutionary change in expression for genes that were sex biased in one species but unbiased in others and found that SBGs evolved faster in expression than unbiased genes. This greater rate of expression evolution of SBGs, also documented in animals, might suggest the possible role of sexual selection in the evolution of gene expression. However, our comparative analysis clearly indicates that the more rapid rate of expression evolution of SBGs predated the origin of bias, and shifts towards bias were depleted in signatures of adaptation. Our results are thus more consistent with the view that sex bias is simply freer to evolve in genes less subject to constraints in expression level.},

abstract = {The loss of recombination between sex chromosomes has occurred repeatedly throughout nature, with important implications for their subsequent evolution. Explanations for this remarkable convergence have generally invoked only adaptive processes (e.g. sexually antagonistic selection); however, there is still little evidence for these hypotheses. Here we propose a model in which recombination on sex chromosomes is lost due to the neutral accumulation of sequence divergence adjacent to (and thus, in linkage disequilibrium with) the sex determiner. Importantly, we include in our model the fact that sequence divergence, in any form, reduces the probability of recombination between any two sequences. Using simulations, we show that, under certain conditions, a region of suppressed recombination arises and expands outwards from the sex-determining locus, under purely neutral processes. Further, we show that the rate and pattern of recombination loss are sensitive to the pre-existing recombination landscape of the genome and to sex differences in recombination rates, with patterns consistent with evolutionary strata emerging under some conditions. We discuss the applicability of these results to natural systems. This article is part of the theme issue “Challenging the paradigm in sex chromosome evolution: empirical and theoretical insights with a focus on vertebrates (Part I)”.},

This is surprising, because both of the two key modes of sexual selection, male-male competition and female choice, could plausibly operate during pollen-pistil interactions where physical male-female contact occurs. Here, we consider how the key processes of sexual selection might affect traits involved in pollen-pistil interactions, including “Fisherian runaway” and “good-genes” models. We review aspects of the molecular and cellular biology of pollen-pistil interactions on which sexual selection could act and point to research that is needed to investigate them.},

We removed males from dioecious populations of the wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua and allowed natural selection to act on the remaining females that occasionally produced male flowers; such “leaky” sex expression is common in both males and females of dioecious plants. 5 Over the course of four generations, females evolved a 23-fold increase in average male flower production. This phenotypic masculinization of females coincided with the evolution of partial self-fertilization, high average seed set in the continued absence of males, and a capacity to sire progeny when males were re-introduced into their populations. Our study thus validates a mechanism for the rapid dissolution of dioecy and the evolution of functional hermaphroditism under conditions that may frequently occur during periods of low population density, repeated colonization, or range expansion. 6 , 7 Our results illustrate the power of natural selection, acting in replicated experimental populations, to bring about transitions in the mating behavior of plants.},

abstract = {In dioecious plants, males and females frequently show “leaky” sex expression, with individuals occasionally producing flowers of the opposite sex. This leaky sex expression may have enabled the colonization of oceanic islands by dioecious plant species, and it is likely to represent the sort of variation upon which selection acts to bring about evolutionary transitions from dioecy to hermaphroditism. Although leakiness is commonly reported for dioecious species, it is not known whether it has plastic component. The question is interesting because males or females with an ability to enhance their leakiness plastically in the absence of mates would have an advantage of being able to produce progeny by self-fertilization. Here, we demonstrate that leaky sex expression in the wind-pollinated dioecious herb Mercurialis annua is plastically responsive to its mating context. We compared experimental populations of females growing either with or without males. Females growing in the absence of males were leakier in their sex expression than controls growing with males, producing more than twice as many male flowers. Our results thus provide a striking instance of plasticity in the reproductive behaviour of plants that is likely adaptive. We consider how females might sense their mating environment as a function of pollen availability, and we discuss possible constraints on the evolution of plasticity in sex expression when the environmental signals that individuals receive are unreliable.},

abstract = {It is commonly observed that plant species’ range margins are enriched for increased selfing rates and, in otherwise self-incompatible species, for self-compatibility (SC). This has often been attributed to a response to selection under mate and/or pollinator limitation. However, range expansion can also cause reduced inbreeding depression, and this could facilitate the evolution of selfing in the absence of mate or pollinator limitation. Here, we explore this idea using spatially explicit individual-based simulations of a range expansion, in which inbreeding depression, variation in self-incompatibility (SI), and mate availability evolve. Under a wide range of conditions, the simulated range expansion brought about the evolution of selfing after the loss of SI in range-marginal populations. Under conditions of high recombination between the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus) and viability loci, SC remained marginal in the expanded metapopulation and could not invade the range core, which remained self-incompatible. In contrast, under low recombination and migration rates, SC was frequently able to displace SI in the range core by maintaining its association with a genomic background with purged genetic load. We conclude that the evolution of inbreeding depression during a range expansion promotes the evolution of SC at range margins, especially under high rates of recombination.‬.},

abstract = {Herkogamy, or anther-stigma separation, is known to reduce self-pollen deposition, but little is known about the relative efficacy of different modes or conformations of herkogamy. We assessed the effectiveness of vertical versus lateral herkogamy in preventing or promoting self-pollen deposition in the annual herb Lysimachia arvensis, a plant with lineages that differ in flower colour, and in which flowers first display lateral and then vertical herkogamy. Because mating between the two lineages compromises fitness through the production of low-quality hybrid offspring, we tested the prediction that individuals sampled from sites occupied by both lineages should have flowers that promote autonomous self-pollen deposition and self-fertilization as a result of selection to reduce deleterious reproductive interference.
We characterized variation in herkogamy within and among 25 pure and mixed populations of L. arvensis in its European range and assessed the effectiveness of lateral versus vertical herkogamy in avoiding self-pollen deposition.
Lateral herkogamy was more effective than vertical herkogamy in limiting self-pollen deposition. In the case of vertical herkogamy, only approach herkogamy was effective. Lineages showed consistent differences in herkogamy traits. In general, angles were smaller for blue than red flowers in most populations, and blue flowers showed approach herkogamy, while red flowers showed predominantly reverse herkogamy. In sympatry, the red lineage showed a reduction of both herkogamy traits while for the blue lineage only lateral herkogamy was reduced.
Our results demonstrate that pollen deposition is affected not only by the degree but also the spatial conformation of herkogamy. They also highlight reduced herkogamy as a potential mechanism for promoting reproductive assurance under pollen limitation, as well as for avoiding reproductive interference between genetically divergent lineages.},

Despite substantial evidence for genetic degeneration at the sequence level, the phenotypic effects of the earliest stages of sex-chromosome evolution are poorly known. Here, we compare the morphology, viability and fertility between XY and YY individuals produced by crossing seed-producing males in the dioecious plant Mercurialis annua, which has young sex chromosomes with limited X-Y sequence divergence. We found no significant difference in viability or vegetative morphology between XY and YY males. However, electron microscopy revealed clear differences in pollen anatomy, and YY males were significantly poorer sires in competition with their XY counterparts. Our study suggests either that the X chromosome is required for full male fertility in M. annua, or that male fertility is sensitive to the dosage of relevant Y-linked genes. We discuss the possibility that the maintenance of male-fertility genes on the X chromosome might have been favoured in recent population expansions that selected for the ability of females to produce pollen in the absence of males.},

Because dominant alleles at these loci are maintained at a lower frequency than their recessive counterparts, they are more likely to be lost by founder events and genetic drift. Here we examine the hypothesis that dominant alleles under negative frequency-dependent selection should also be more likely to re-invade populations than recessive alleles, due to Haldane’s Sieve, because recessive alleles not expressed in a heterozygote state cannot benefit from positive selection when rare. We used computer simulations of tristylous metapopulations to verify that Haldane’s Sieve acting on migrants into occupied demes can indeed reverse the bias in allele frequencies expected for small single tristylous populations, particularly in situations of rapid population growth following colonisation. This effect is manifest both locally and at the metapopulation level. Our study illustrates the potential effect of Haldane’s Sieve in the novel context of an iconic plant sexual-system polymorphism under the influence of metapopulation dynamics.},

abstract = {Polyploidy has played a major role in the origin of new plant species, probably because of the expansion of polyploid populations in the species’ ecological niche, and because reproductive isolation can be established between a new polyploid population and its diploid progenitor species. It is well established that most polyploid species are polyphyletic, with multiple independent origins, and that polyploid genomes may undergo rapid change after their duplication and hybridization associated with their origin. We considered whether multiple independent origins and rapid genomic change might lead to reproductive isolation between polyploid populations of the same ploidy but with potentially different evolutionary histories.
We tested our hypothesis by assessing differences in DNA content and morphology, the evolution of reproductive isolation, and the phylogenetic placement of two broadly sympatric hexaploid lineages of the wind-pollinated annual plant Mercurialis annua hitherto regarded as populations of the same species.
The two hexaploid lineages of M. annua have slightly divergent DNA content, and distinct inflorescence morphology. They also fall into largely different clades of a chloroplast phylogeny and are reproductively isolated from one another.
The distinct evolutionary histories of the two hexaploid lineages of M. annua have contributed to the remarkable reproductive diversity of the species complex. It seems likely that reproductive interference between them will eventually lead to the displacement of one lineage by the other via pollen swamping. Thus, whereas polyploidization can contribute to speciation, diversification might also be compromised by reproductive interference.},

abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in morphology, physiology or life history traits is common in dioecious plants at reproductive maturity, but it is typically inconspicuous or absent in juveniles. Although plants of different sexes probably begin to diverge in gene expression both before their reproduction commences and before dimorphism becomes readily apparent, to our knowledge transcriptome-wide differential gene expression has yet to be demonstrated for any angiosperm species.
The present study documents differences in gene expression in both above- and below-ground tissues of early pre-reproductive individuals of the wind-pollinated dioecious annual herb, Mercurialis annua, which otherwise shows clear sexual dimorphism only at the adult stage.
Whereas males and females differed in their gene expression at the first leaf stage, sex-biased gene expression peaked just prior to, and after, flowering, as might be expected if sexual dimorphism is partly a response to differential costs of reproduction. Sex-biased genes were over-represented among putative sex-linked genes in M. annua but showed no evidence for more rapid evolution than unbiased genes.
Sex-biased gene expression in M. annua occurs as early as the first whorl of leaves is produced, is highly dynamic during plant development and varies substantially between vegetative tissues.},

abstract = {Suppressed recombination allows divergence between homologous sex chromosomes and the functionality of their genes. Here, we reveal patterns of the earliest stages of sex-chromosome evolution in the diploid dioecious herb Mercurialis annua on the basis of cytological analysis, de novo genome assembly and annotation, genetic mapping, exome resequencing of natural populations, and transcriptome analysis. The genome assembly contained 34,105 expressed genes, of which 10,076 were assigned to linkage groups. Genetic mapping and exome resequencing of individuals across the species range both identified the largest linkage group, LG1, as the sex chromosome. Although the sex chromosomes of M. annua are karyotypically homomorphic, we estimate that about one-third of the Y chromosome, containing 568 transcripts and spanning 22.3 cM in the corresponding female map, has ceased recombining. Nevertheless, we found limited evidence for Y-chromosome degeneration in terms of gene loss and pseudogenization, and most X- and Y-linked genes appear to have diverged in the period subsequent to speciation between M. annua and its sister species M. huetii, which shares the same sex-determining region. Taken together, our results suggest that the M. annua Y chromosome has at least two evolutionary strata: a small old stratum shared with M. huetii, and a more recent larger stratum that is probably unique to M. annua and that stopped recombining ∼1 MYA. Patterns of gene expression within the nonrecombining region are consistent with the idea that sexually antagonistic selection may have played a role in favoring suppressed recombination.},

abstract = {Bateman’s principles posit that male fitness varies more, and relies more on mate acquisition, than female fitness. While Bateman’s principles should apply to any organism producing gametes of variable sizes, their application to plants is potentially complicated by the high levels of polyandry suspected for plants, and by variation in the spatial distribution of prospective mates. Here we quantify the intensity of sexual selection by classical Bateman metrics using two common gardens of the wind-pollinated dioecious plant Mercurialis annua. Consistent with Bateman’s principles, males displayed significantly positive Bateman gradients (a regression of fitness on mate number), whereas the reproductive success of females was independent of their ability to access mates. A large part of male fitness was explained by their mate number, which in turn was associated with males’ abilities to disperse pollen. Our results suggest that sexual selection can act in plant species in much the same way as in many animals, increasing the number of mates through traits that promote pollen dispersal.},

abstract = {Plants with separate sexes often show “inconstant” or “leaky” sex expression, with females or males producing a few flowers of the opposite sex. The frequency and degree of such inconstancy may reflect residual hermaphroditic sex allocation after an evolutionary transition from combined to separate sexes. Sex inconstancy also represents a possible first step in the breakdown of dioecy back to hermaphroditism. In the Mercurialis annua (Euphorbiaceae) species complex, monoecy and androdioecy have evolved from dioecy in polyploid populations. Here, we characterize patterns of sex inconstancy in dioecious M. annua and discuss how sex inconstancy may have contributed to the breakdown of separate sexes in the genus.
We measured sex inconstancy in three common gardens of M. annua over 2 years using a modification of Lloyd’s phenotypic gender in terms of frequency and degree, with the degree calibrating inconstancy against the sex allocation of constant males and constant females, yielding a measure of gender that does not depend on the distribution of gender in the population.
Unusually for dioecious plants, the frequency of sex inconstancy in M. annua was greater in females, but its degree was greater for males in the 2 years of study. We suggest that this pattern is consistent with the maintenance of inconstancy in dioecious M. annua by selection for reproductive assurance under mate limitation.
Our study illustrates the utility of decomposing measures of sex inconstancy into its frequency and its degree and throws new light on the origin of variation in sexual systems in Mercurialis.},

abstract = {Sexual selection may contribute to the evolution of plant sexual dimorphism by favoring architectural traits in males that improve pollen dispersal to mates. In both sexes, larger individuals may be favored by allowing the allocation of more resources to gamete production (a “budget” effect of size). In wind-pollinated plants, large size may also benefit males by allowing the liberation of pollen from a greater height, fostering its dispersal (a “direct” effect of size). To assess these effects and their implications for trait selection, we measured selection on plant morphology in both males and females of the wind-pollinated dioecious herb Mercurialis annua in two separate experimental common gardens at contrasting density. In both gardens, selection strongly favored males that disperse their pollen further. Selection for pollen production was observed in the high-density garden only, and was weak. In addition, male morphologies associated with increased mean pollen dispersal differed between the two gardens, as elongated branches were favored in the high-density garden, whereas shorter plants with longer inflorescence stalks were favored in the low-density garden. Larger females were selected in both gardens. Our results point to the importance of both a direct effect of selection on male traits that affect pollen dispersal, and, to a lesser extent, a budget effect of selection on pollen production.},

We introduced self-compatible (SC) individuals at different frequencies into replicate experimental populations of L. cavanillesii that varied in access to pollinators. Our experiment revealed a rapid shift to self-compatibility in all replicates, driven by both greater seed set and greater outcross siring success of SC individuals. We discuss our results in the light of computer simulations that confirm the tendency of self-compatibility to spread into SI populations under the observed conditions. Our study illustrates the ease with which self-compatibility can spread among populations, a requisite for species-wide transitions from self-incompatibility to self-compatibility.},

abstract = {Dioecy has often broken down in flowering plants, yielding functional hermaphroditism. We reasoned that evolutionary transitions from dioecy to functional hermaphroditism must overcome an inertia of sexual dimorphism, because modified males or females will express the opposite sexual function for which their phenotypes have been optimised. We tested this prediction by assessing the siring success of monoecious individuals of the plant Mercurialis annua with an acquired male function but that are phenotypically still female-like. We found that pollen dispersed by female-like monoecious individuals was ~ 1/3 poorer at siring outcrossed offspring than pollen from monoecious individuals with an alternative male-like inflorescence. We conclude that whereas dioecy might evolve from functional hermaphroditism by conferring upon individuals certain benefits of sexual specialisation, reversion from a strategy of separate sexes to one of combined sexes must overcome constraints imposed by the advantages of sexual dimorphism. The breakdown of dioecy must therefore often be limited to situations in which outcrossing cannot be maintained and where selection favours a capacity for inbreeding by functional hermaphrodites.},

Attracting pollinators thus not only benefits individuals investing in advertising, but also other plants in a patch through a “magnet” effect. Accordingly, there could be an indirect fitness advantage to greater investment in costly floral displays by plants in kin-structured groups than when in groups of unrelated individuals. Here, we seek evidence for this strategy by manipulating relatedness in groups of the plant Moricandia moricandioides, an insect-pollinated herb that typically grows in patches. As predicted, individuals growing with kin, particularly at high density, produced larger floral displays than those growing with non-kin. Investment in attracting pollinators was thus moulded by the presence and relatedness of neighbours, exemplifying the importance of kin recognition in the evolution of plant reproductive strategies.},

The loss of SI may often lead to an increase in the selfing rate, with the purging of inbreeding depression and the ultimate evolution of a selfing syndrome, where plants have smaller flowers with reduced pollen and nectar production. In this study, we used approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the timing of divergence between populations of the plant Linaria cavanillesii that differ in SI status and in which SI is associated with low inbreeding depression but not with a transition to full selfing or a selfing syndrome. Our analysis suggests that the mixed-mating self-compatible (SC) population may have begun to diverge from the SI populations around 2810 generation ago, a period perhaps too short for the evolution of a selfing syndrome. We conjecture that the SC population of L. cavanillesii is at an intermediate stage of transition between outcrossing and selfing.},

Distyly can be associated with divergence in the functional gender between long- and short-styled individuals, but gender divergence has rarely been investigated in species with a simple stigma height polymorphism in the absence of reciprocal dimorphism in anther position. To evaluate the relation between stigma height polymorphism and gender, I measured the dimensions of floral morphology and seed production for the two morphs of a large population of the Iberian species Lithodora fruticosa (Boraginaceae). Results confirm the existence of a stigma height polymorphism in L. fruticosa, with long- and short-styled individuals at a 1:1 ratio in the studied population. Long-styled individuals produced substantially more seeds than did short-styled individuals, pointing to strong divergence in functional gender between the two morphs. The results of this study are puzzling in light of recent work that suggests that L. fruticosa has a multi-allelic self-incompatibility system. I discuss the significance of gender divergence in L. fruticosa and evaluate hypotheses that might explain it.

abstract = {Plants vary widely in the extent to which they defend themselves against herbivores. Because the resources available to plants are often site-specific, variation among sites dictates investment into defence and may reveal a growth-defence trade-off. Moreover, plants that have evolved different life-history strategies in different environments may situate themselves on this trade-off curve differently. For instance, plants that flower later have a longer vegetative life span and may accordingly defend themselves differently than those that flower earlier. Here, we tested whether late-flowering plants, with a longer vegetative life span, invest more in defence than early-flowering plants, using recombinant genotypes of the annual herb Cardamine hirsuta that differ in flowering time as a result of differences in the activity of the major floral repressor Flowering Locus C (FLC). We found that variation at FLC was mainly responsible for regulating flowering time and allocation to reproduction, but this partially depended on where the plants grew. We also found that variation at FLC mediated plant allocation to defence, with late-flowering plants producing higher levels of total glucosinolates and stress-related phytohormones. Nonetheless, plant growth and the qualitative values of plant defence and plant resistance against specialist herbivores were mainly independent from FLC.Synthesis. Our results highlight pleiotropic effects associated with flowering-time genes that might influence plant defence and plant-herbivore interactions.},

abstract = {Neutral genetic diversity gradients have long been used to infer the colonization history of species [1, 2], but range expansion may also influence the efficacy of natural selection and patterns of non-synonymous polymorphism in different parts of a species’ range [3]. Recent theory predicts both an accumulation of deleterious mutations and a reduction in the efficacy of positive selection as a result of range expansion [4-8]. These signatures have been sought in a number of studies of the human range expansion out of Africa, but with contradictory results [9-14]. We analyzed the polymorphism patterns of 578,125 SNPs (17,648 genes) in the European diploid plant Mercurialis annua, which expanded its range from an eastern Mediterranean refugium into western habitats with contrasted climates [15]. Our results confirmed strong signatures of bottlenecks and revealed the accumulation of mildly to strongly deleterious mutations in range-front populations. A significantly higher number of these mutations were homozygous in individuals in range-front populations, pointing to increased genetic load and reduced fitness under a model of recessive deleterious effects. We also inferred a reduction in the number of selective sweeps in range-front versus core populations. These signatures have persisted even in a dioecious herb subject to substantial interpopulation gene flow [15]. Our results extend support from humans to plants for theory on the dynamics of mutations under selection during range expansion, showing that colonization bottlenecks can compromise adaptive potential.},

abstract = {Mercurialis annua is a wind-pollinated annual plant that has long been used as a model for the study of ploidy and sexual-systems evolution. However, no molecular markers are yet available for genetic studies of its diploid populations. Here, we develop and characterize a set of eight polymorphic microsatellite markers for diploid dioecious M. annua.
Following an SSR-enrichment protocol, 13 microsatellite markers were proposed, eight of which yielded successful amplification and polymorphism. We screened the eight microsatellite loci in 100 individuals. The number of alleles per marker ranged from 6 to 12, and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.57 to 0.76. To estimate potential allele scoring errors, these individuals’ offspring were genotyped for the same loci, and error rates were estimated from parentage analyses. Error rates ranged from 0 to 6.8%. Cross-amplification tests were performed for congeneric M. huetti and M. canariensis, with successful amplification for seven and six of the eight loci, respectively. The novel microsatellite markers proposed here will be crucial for a multitude of genetic studies of M. annua and further establish its importance as a model species for addressing ecological and population genetic questions.},

abstract = {1. Plant demography is known to depend on both spatial dynamics and life history, but how these two factors interact is poorly understood. We conducted a longitudinal study of the wind-pollinated annual plant Mercurialis annua that varies geographically in its sexual system to investigate this interaction. 

2. Metapopulation demographic models predict that regular population turnover should be a more common feature of monomorphic than dimorphic populations because males and females cannot found new populations by selfing but hermaphrodites can. We tested the prediction that rates of population turnover would be higher in monomorphic compared to dimorphic regions. 

3. We surveyed 356 populations of M. annua along five regional transects in Morocco and the Iberian Peninsula over a 3-year period to examine their demography and persistence. Each transect crossed a transition in the sexual system, from a monomorphic region where almost all populations were hermaphroditic to a dimorphic one in which most populations had separate sexes (males with females or hermaphrodites). 

4. As predicted, rates of local apparent extinctions (i.e., the disappearance of adult plants) were nearly 50% higher in monomorphic compared to dimorphic regions. Local extinctions appeared to be driven by changes in vegetation cover, with extinctions tending to occur in sites in which perennial cover also declined. This suggests that disturbance is a primary agent of local extinctions. 

5. We further examined the influence of regional dynamics on local demographic properties by investigating patterns of spatial autocorrelation in population density across years. We found positive spatial autocorrelations in plant densities within regions for both sexual systems. However, these positive autocorrelations extended over shorter distances in monomorphic regions, perhaps as a result of greater population flux in these regions. 

6. Synthesis. Our study shows that population dynamics may be influenced by processes acting at a range of spatial scales: within patches, across patches within sites, and across sites within regions, as well as by life-history variation. In Mercurialis annua, regional variation in apparent extinction rates is affected by life history and implicated in regulating the geographical distribution of populations with different sexual systems.},

abstract = {Because establishing a new population often depends critically on finding mates, individuals capable of uniparental reproduction may have a colonization advantage. Accordingly, there should be an over-representation of colonizing species in which individuals can reproduce without a mate, particularly in isolated locales such as oceanic islands. Despite the intuitive appeal of this colonization filter hypothesis (known as Baker’s law), more than six decades of analyses have yielded mixed findings. We assembled a dataset of island and mainland plant breeding systems, focusing on the presence or absence of self-incompatibility. Because this trait enforces outcrossing and is unlikely to re-evolve on short timescales if it is lost, breeding system is especially likely to reflect the colonization filter. We found significantly more self-compatible species on islands than mainlands across a sample of &gt; 1500 species from three widely distributed flowering plant families (Asteraceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae). Overall, 66% of island species were self-compatible, compared with 41% of mainland species. Our results demonstrate that the presence or absence of self-incompatibility has strong explanatory power for plant geographical patterns. Island floras around the world thus reflect the role of a key reproductive trait in filtering potential colonizing species in these three plant families.

abstract = {Dioecy, the coexistence of separate male and female individuals in a population, is a rare but phylogenetically widespread sexual system in flowering plants. While research has concentrated on why and how dioecy evolves from hermaphroditism, the question of why dioecy is rare, despite repeated transitions to it, has received much less attention. Previous phylogenetic and theoretical studies have suggested that dioecy might be an evolutionary dead end. However, recent research indicates that the phylogenetic support for this hypothesis is attributable to a methodological bias and that there is no evidence for reduced diversification in dioecious angiosperms. The relative rarity of dioecy thus remains a puzzle. Here, we review evidence for the hypothesis that dioecy might be rare not because it is an evolutionary dead end, but rather because it easily reverts to hermaphroditism. We review what is known about transitions between hermaphroditism and dioecy, and conclude that there is an important need to consider more widely the possibility of transitions away from dioecy, both from an empirical and a theoretical point of view, and by combining tools from molecular evolution and insights from ecology.

abstract = {1. Low pollination intensity may cause low seed set in plant populations and is thought to be responsible for evolutionary transitions from outcrossing to selfing, or from animal to wind pollination. Variation in pollination intensity may also affect seed quality both through its influence on the degree of pollen competition (with lower quality offspring produced under low pollen intensities) and through seed size-number trade-offs (with plants under low pollination intensity producing fewer but larger seeds).

2. Here, we use a field experiment to examine the effects of pollination intensity on both quantity and quality of progeny. We manipulated pollen receipt to stigmas of the wind-pollinated dioecious plant Mercurialis annua by varying the distance of females from males. We then compared seed size and number, seedling growth and allocation to male and female function, for the progeny produced by females subjected to different pollination intensities.

3. Our experiment revealed a reduction in pollen load with increasing distance to males, translating into large reductions in the number of seeds produced but only small effects on the performance of offspring. The main effect on offspring quality was through a seed size-number trade-off, with pollen-limited females producing fewer but larger seeds, which subsequently performed better. Sons and daughters were affected differently by this trade-off, pointing to gender-dependent effects of pollination intensity on progeny performance.

4. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of pollination intensity on both the quantity and quality of progeny. Nevertheless, fitness calculations suggest that the enhanced quality of seed produced by pollen-limited mothers was not sufficient to offset their losses in terms of quantity.},

abstract = {Sex determination is as important for the fitness of plants as it is for animals, but its mechanisms appear to vary much more among plants than among animals, and the expression of gender in plants differs in important respects from that in most animals. In this Minireview, I provide an overview of the broad variety of ways in which plants determine sex. I suggest that several important peculiarities of plant sex determination can be understood by recognising that: plants show an alternation of generations between sporophytic and gametophytic phases (either of which may take control of sex determination); plants are modular in structure and lack a germ line (allowing for a quantitative expression of gender that is not common in animals); and separate sexes in plants have ultimately evolved from hermaphroditic ancestors. Most theorising about sex determination in plants has focused on dioecious species, but we have much to learn from monecious or hermaphroditic species, where sex is determined at the level of modules, tissues or cells. Because of the fundamental modularity of plant development and potentially important evolutionary links between monoecy and dioecy, it may be useful to relax the distinction often made between “developmental sex determination” (which underpins the development of male versus female flowers in monoecious species) and “genetic sex determination” (which underpins the separation of males and females in dioecious species, often mediated by a genetic polymorphism and sex chromosomes). I also argue for relaxing the distinction between sex determination involving a genetic polymorphism and that involving responses to environmental or hormonal cues, because non-genetic cues might easily be converted into genetic switches.

One such trait is a plant’s sex allocation (or gender), which influences its reproductive success directly as a function of the potentially heterogeneous mating prospects in the population. However, it is unknown how polyploidy per se might affect plasticity in a plant’s sex allocation. Although there have been numerous comparisons between diploid and (usually) tetraploid taxa, we know very little about how elevated ploidy above the diploid level might affect plasticity. Here, we ask whether different ploidy levels &gt; 2x express different plasticity in the ruderal plant Mercurialis annua. We grew tetraploid and hexaploid hermaphrodites under different levels of nutrient availability and compared their reaction norms for growth (above-ground biomass, SLA) and reproductive traits (reproductive effort, phenotypic gender). Overall, we found that an increase in ploidy level from 4x to 6x in M. annua is associated with an increase in the relative biomass allocated to seeds, measured as female reproductive effort. However, our study provides no support for the idea that increasing ploidy level increases the ability to express different phenotypes in response to changes in the environment.

abstract = {The differential plasticity hypothesis suggests that sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants could evolve in response to sex-specific resource requirements for reproduction (i.e., high carbon requirements for ovules and high nitrogen demands for pollen). When resources become limiting during growth, males and females should, therefore, adjust their allocation to resource-harvesting organs differently. To investigate the potential for plants to respond to resource limitation late in life and to test the differential plasticity hypothesis, we grew male and female individuals of the annual wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua in a common garden. Late in the growth season, we simulated a change in competition by decreasing plant density in half of the replicates. We measured both allocation to vegetative and reproductive traits and analyzed the relative allocation to reproduction vs. growth. Males and females differentially adjusted their resource allocation in response to varying plant densities, despite the fact that they were reproductively mature. Males maintained the same relative allocation of resource to reproductive vs. vegetative tissues at both densities. In contrast, females reduced vegetative growth proportionally less than seed production at the higher density. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of allocation decisions taken by plants, which respond quickly and in a sexually dimorphic way to changes in their competitive circumstances. The existence of resource “currencies” limiting male and female functions differently have potentially led to the evolution of sex-specific strategies of resource acquisition and deployment, with females conserving resources for vegetative organs to ensure their future carbon-rich reproduction.},

abstract = {High inbreeding depression is thought to be one of the major factors preventing evolutionary transitions in hermaphroditic plants from self-incompatibility (SI) and outcrossing toward self-compatibility (SC) and selfing. However, when selfing does evolve, inbreeding depression can be quickly purged, allowing the evolution of complete self-fertilization. In contrast, populations that show intermediate selfing rates (a mixed-mating system) typically show levels of inbreeding depression similar to those in outcrossing species, suggesting that selection against inbreeding might be responsible for preventing the transition toward complete self-fertilization. By implication, crosses among populations should reveal patterns of heterosis for mixed-mating populations that are similar to those expected for outcrossing populations. Using hand-pollination crosses, we compared levels of inbreeding depression and heterosis between populations of Linaria cavanillesii (Plantaginaceae), a perennial herb showing contrasting mating systems. The SI population showed high inbreeding depression, whereas the SC population displaying mixed mating showed no inbreeding depression. In contrast, we found that heterosis based on between-population crosses was similar for SI and SC populations. Our results are consistent with the rapid purging of inbreeding depression in the derived SC population, despite the persistence of mixed mating. However, the maintenance of outcrossing after a transition to SC is inconsistent with the prediction that populations that have purged their inbreeding depression should evolve toward complete selfing, suggesting that the transition to SC in L. cavanillesii has been recent. SC in L. cavanillesii thus exemplifies a situation in which the mating system is likely not at an equilibrium with inbreeding depression.

abstract = {Many hermaphroditic plants avoid self-fertilization by means of a molecular self-incompatibility (SI) system, a complex trait that is difficult to evolve but relatively easy to lose. Loss of SI is a prerequisite for an evolutionary transition from obligate outcrossing to self-fertilization, which may bring about rapid changes in the genetic diversity and structure of populations. Loss of SI is also often followed by the evolution of a “selfing syndrome”, with plants having small flowers, little nectar and few pollen grains per ovule. Here, we document the loss of SI in the long-lived Spanish toadflax Linaria cavanillesii, which has led to mixed mating rather than a transition to a high rate of selfing and in which an outcrossing syndrome has been maintained.
We performed crosses within and among six populations of L. cavanillesii in the glasshouse, measured floral traits in a common-garden experiment, performed a pollen-limitation experiment in the field and conducted population genetic analyses using microsatellites markers.
Controlled crosses revealed variation in SI from fully SI through intermediate SI to fully self-compatible (SC). Flowers of SC individuals showed no evidence of a selfing syndrome. Although the SC population of L. cavanillesii had lower within-population genetic diversity than SI populations, as expected, population differentiation among all populations was extreme and represents an FST outlier in the distribution for both selfing and outcrossing species of flowering plants.
Together, our results suggest that the transition to SC in L. cavanillesii has probably been very recent, and may have been aided by selection during or following a colonization bottleneck rather than in the absence of pollinators. We find little indication that the transition to SC has been driven by selection for reproductive assurance under conditions currently prevailing in natural populations.

abstract = {In flowering plants, many dioecious species display a certain degree of sexual dimorphism in non-reproductive traits, but this dimorphism tends to be much less striking than that found in animals. Sexual size dimorphism in plants may be limited because competition for light in crowded environments so strongly penalises small plants. The idea that competition for light constrains the evolution of strong sexual size dimorphism in plants (the size-constraint hypothesis) implies a strong dependency of the expression of sexual size dimorphism on the neighbouring density as a result of the capacity of plants to adjust their reproductive effort and investment in growth in response to their local environment. Here, we tested this hypothesis by experimentally altering the context of competition for light among male-female pairs of the light-demanding dioecious annual plant Mercurialis annua. We found that males were smaller than females across all treatments, but sexual size dimorphism was diminished for pairs grown at higher densities. This result is consistent with the size-constraint hypothesis. We discuss our results in terms of the tension between selection on size acting in opposite directions on males and females, which have different optima under sexual selection, and stabilizing selection for similar sizes in males and females, which have similar optima under viability selection for plasticity in size expression under different density conditions.

abstract = {Colonization is likely to be more successful for species with an ability to self-fertilize and thus to establish new populations as single individuals. As a result, self-compatibility should be common among colonizing species. This idea, labelled “Baker’s law”, has been influential in discussions of sexual-system and mating-system evolution. However, its generality has been questioned, because models of the evolution of dispersal and the mating system predict an association between high dispersal rates and outcrossing rather than selfing, and because of many apparent counter examples to the law. The contrasting predictions made by models invoking Baker’s law versus those for the evolution of the mating system and dispersal urges a reassessment of how we should view both these traits. Here, I review the literature on the evolution of mating and dispersal in colonizing species, with a focus on conceptual issues. I argue for the importance of distinguishing between the selfing or outcrossing rate and a simple ability to self-fertilize, as well as for the need for a more nuanced consideration of dispersal. Colonizing species will be characterized by different phases in their life pattern: dispersal to new habitat, implying an ecological sieve on dispersal traits; establishment and a phase of growth following colonization, implying a sieve on reproductive traits; and a phase of demographic stasis at high density, during which new trait associations can evolve through local adaptation. This dynamic means that the sorting of mating-system and dispersal traits should change over time, making simple predictions difficult.},

Recent theoretical work has again questioned the generality and scope of Baker’s law. Here, we attempt to discern where the idea is useful to apply and where it is not. We conclude that several of the perceived problems with Baker’s law fall away when a narrower perspective is adopted on how it should be circumscribed. We emphasize that Baker’s law should be read in terms of an enrichment of a capacity for uniparental reproduction in colonizing situations, rather than of high selfing rates. We suggest that Baker’s law might be tested in four different contexts, which set the breadth of its scope: the colonization of oceanic islands, metapopulation dynamics with recurrent colonization, range expansions with recurrent colonization, and colonization through species invasions.},

abstract = {Many eukaryote organisms are polyploid. However, despite their importance, evolutionary inference of polyploid origins and modes of inheritance has been limited by a need for analyses of allele segregation at multiple loci using crosses. The increasing availability of sequence data for nonmodel species now allows the application of established approaches for the analysis of genomic data in polyploids. Here, we ask whether approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), applied to realistic traditional and next-generation sequence data, allows correct inference of the evolutionary and demographic history of polyploids. Using simulations, we evaluate the robustness of evolutionary inference by ABC for tetraploid species as a function of the number of individuals and loci sampled, and the presence or absence of an outgroup. We find that ABC adequately retrieves the recent evolutionary history of polyploid species on the basis of both old and new sequencing technologies. The application of ABC to sequence data from diploid and polyploid species of the plant genus Capsella confirms its utility. Our analysis strongly supports an allopolyploid origin of C. bursa-pastoris about 80 000 years ago. This conclusion runs contrary to previous findings based on the same data set but using an alternative approach and is in agreement with recent findings based on whole-genome sequencing. Our results indicate that ABC is a promising and powerful method for revealing the evolution of polyploid species, without the need to attribute alleles to a homeologous chromosome pair. The approach can readily be extended to more complex scenarios involving higher ploidy levels.},

abstract = {Separate sexes have evolved on numerous independent occasions from hermaphroditic ancestors in flowering plants. The mechanisms of sex determination is known for only a handful of such species, but, in those that have been investigated, it usually involves alleles segregating at a single locus, sometimes on heteromorphic sex chromosomes. In the genus Mercurialis, transitions between combined (hermaphroditism) and separate sexes (dioecy or androdioecy, where males co-occur with hermaphrodites rather than females) have occurred more than once in association with hybridisation and shifts in ploidy. Previous work has pointed to an unusual 3-locus system of sex determination in dioecious populations. Here, we use crosses and genotyping for a sex-linked marker to reject this model: sex in diploid dioecious M. annua is determined at a single locus with a dominant male-determining allele (an XY system). We also crossed individuals among lineages of Mercurialis that differ in their ploidy and sexual system to ascertain the extent to which the same sex-determination system has been conserved following genome duplication, hybridisation and transitions between dioecy and hermaphroditism. Our results indicate that the male-determining element is fully capable of determining gender in the progeny of hybrids between different lineages. Specifically, males crossed with females or hermaphrodites always generate 1:1 male:female or male:hermaphrodite sex ratios, respectively, regardless of the ploidy levels involved (diploid, tetraploid or hexaploid). Our results throw further light on the genetics of the remarkable variation in sexual systems in the genus Mercurialis. They also illustrate the almost identical expression of sex-determining alleles in terms of sexual phenotypes across multiple divergent backgrounds, including those that have lost separate sexes altogether.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The coexistence of hermaphrodites and female-sterile individuals, or androdioecy, has been documented in only a handful of plants and animals. This study reports its existence in the plant species Cardamine amara (Brassicaceae), in which female-sterile individuals have shorter pistils than seed-producing hermaphrodites.
METHODS: Morphological analysis, in situ manual pollination, microsatellite genotyping and differential gene expression analysis using Arabidopsis microarrays were used to delimit variation between female-sterile individuals and hermaphrodites.
KEY RESULTS: Female sterility in C. amara appears to be caused by disrupted ovule development. It was associated with a 2.4- to 2.9-fold increase in clonal propagation. This made the pollen number of female-sterile genets more than double that of hermaphrodite genets, which fulfils a condition of co-existence predicted by simple androdioecy theories. When female-sterile individuals were observed in wild androdioecious populations, their ramet frequencies ranged from 5 to 54 %; however, their genet frequencies ranged from 11 to 29 %, which is consistent with the theoretically predicted upper limit of 50 %.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a combination of sexual reproduction and increased asexual proliferation by female-sterile individuals probably explains the invasion and maintenance of female sterility in otherwise hermaphroditic populations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the coexistence of female sterility and hermaphrodites in the Brassicaceae.},

abstract = {In androdioecious metapopulations, where males co-occur with hermaphrodites, the absence of males from certain populations or regions may be explained by locally high selfing rates, high hermaphrodite outcross siring success (e.g. due to high pollen production by hermaphrodites), or to stochastic processes (e.g. the failure of males to invade populations or regions following colonization or range expansion by hermaphrodites). In the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco, the presence of males with hermaphrodites in the wind-pollinated androdioecious plant Mercurialis annua (Euphorbiaceae) varies both among populations within relatively small regions and among regions, with some regions lacking males from all populations. The species is known to have expanded its range into the Iberian Peninsula from a southern refugium. To account for variation in male presence in M. annua, we test the following hypotheses: (1) that males are absent in areas where plant densities are lower, because selfing rates should be correspondingly higher; (2) that males are absent in areas where hermaphrodites produce more pollen; and (3) that males are absent in areas where there is an elevated proportion of populations in which plant density and hermaphrodite pollen production disfavour their invasion. We found support for predictions two and three in Morocco (the putative Pleistocene refugium for M. annua) but no support for any hypothesis in Iberia (the expanded range). Our results are partially consistent with a hypothesis of sex-allocation equilibrium for populations in Morocco; in Iberia, the absence of males from large geographical regions is more consistent with a model of sex-ratio evolution in a metapopulation with recurrent population turnover. Our study points to the role of both frequency-dependent selection and contingencies imposed by colonization during range expansions and in metapopulations.},

abstract = {Most plant species are hermaphrodites, with both male and female functions performed by the same individuals. However, separate sexes (dioecy) have evolved on numerous independent occasions, probably either in response to selection for inbreeding avoidance, or because it pays individuals to specialize in one gender or the other. Although the evolution of dioecy from hermaphroditism tends to be thought of as a one-way path, dioecy has broken down to yield hermaphroditic populations on several occasions. One such case is found in the mainly dioecious genus Mercurialis (Euphorbiaceae). In the species complex M. annua, diploids are dioecious, but polyploid populations are variously monoecious or androdioecious (where males co-exist with functional hermaphrodites). This species complex offers rich material for addressing questions concerning the evolution and ecology of combined versus separate sexes, the evolution of secondary sexual dimorphism, which likely contributes to the stability of dioecy in the genus, and the evolution and genetics of sex determination and sex chromosomes. The species also offers itself as a valuable teaching tool for addressing topics ranging from sex-ratio selection to inter-sexual competition.},

abstract = {The evolution of senescence (the physiological decline of organisms with age) poses an apparent paradox because it represents a failure of natural selection to increase the survival and reproductive performance of organisms. The paradox can be resolved if natural selection becomes less effective with age, because the death of postreproductive individuals should have diminished effects on Darwinian fitness [1, 2]. A substantial body of empirical work is consistent with this prediction for animals, which transmit their genes to progeny via an immortal germline. However, such evidence is still lacking in plants, which lack a germline and whose reproduction is diffuse and modular across the soma. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a genetic basis of senescence in the short-lived perennial plant Silene latifolia. Our pedigree-based analysis revealed a marked increase with age in the additive genetic variance of traits closely associated with fitness. This result thus extends to plants the quantitative genetic support for the evolutionary theory of senescence.},

abstract = {Plants are notoriously variable in gender, ranging in sex allocation from purely male through hermaphrodite to purely female. This variation can have both a genetic and an adaptive plastic component. In gynodioecious species, where females co-occur with hermaphrodites, hermaphrodites tend to shift their allocation towards greater maleness when growing under low-resource conditions, either as a result of hermaphrodites shifting away from an expensive female function, or because of enhanced siring advantages in the presence of females. Similarly, in the androdioecious plant Mercurialis annua, where hermaphrodites co-exist with males, hermaphrodites also tend to enhance their relative male allocation under low-resource conditions. Here, we ask whether this response differs between hermaphrodites that have been evolving in the presence of males, in a situation analogous to that supposed for gynodioecious populations, vs. those that have been evolving in their absence. We grew hermaphrodites of M. annua from populations in which males were either present or absent under different levels of nutrient availability and compared their reaction norms. We found that, overall, hermaphrodites from populations with males tended to be more female than those from populations lacking males. Importantly, hermaphrodites’ investment in pollen and seed production was more plastic when they came from populations with males than without them, reducing their pollen production at low resource availability and increasing their seed production at high resource availability. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that plasticity in sex allocation is enhanced in hermaphrodites that have likely been exposed to variation in mating opportunities due to fluctuations in the frequency of co-occurring males.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Research into the evolution of subdivided plant populations has long involved the study of phenotypic variation across plant geographic ranges and the genetic details underlying that variation. Genetic polymorphism at different marker loci has also allowed us to infer the long- and short-term histories of gene flow within and among populations, including range expansions and colonization-extinction dynamics. However, the advent of affordable genome-wide sequences for large numbers of individuals is opening up new possibilities for the study of subdivided populations. In this review, we consider what the new tools and technologies may allow us to do. In particular, we encourage researchers to look beyond the description of variation and to use genomic tools to address new hypotheses, or old ones afresh. Because subdivided plant populations are complex structures, we caution researchers away from adopting simplistic interpretations of their data, and to consider the patterns they observe in terms of the population genetic processes that have given rise to them; here, the genealogical framework of the coalescent will continue to be conceptually and analytically useful.},

abstract = {Mating with more than one pollen donor, or polyandry, is common in land plants. In flowering plants, polyandry occurs when the pollen from different potential sires is distributed among the fruits of a single individual, or when pollen from more than one donor is deposited on the same stigma. Because polyandry typically leads to multiple paternity among or within fruits, it can be indirectly inferred on the basis of paternity analysis using molecular markers. A review of the literature indicates that polyandry is probably ubiquitous in plants except those that habitually self-fertilize, or that disperse their pollen in pollen packages, such as polyads or pollinia. Multiple mating may increase plants’ female component by alleviating pollen limitation or by promoting competition among pollen grains from different potential sires. Accordingly, a number of traits have evolved that should promote polyandry at the flower level from the female’s point of view, e.g. the prolongation of stigma receptivity or increases in stigma size. However, many floral traits, such as attractiveness, the physical manipulation of pollinators and pollen-dispensing mechanisms that lead to polyandrous pollination, have probably evolved in response to selection to promote male siring success in general, so that polyandry might often best be seen as a by-product of selection to enhance outcross siring success. In this sense, polyandry in plants is similar to geitonogamy (selfing caused by pollen transfer among flowers of the same plant), because both polyandry and geitonogamy probably result from selection to promote outcross siring success, although geitonogamy is almost always deleterious while polyandry in plants will seldom be so.},

abstract = {Trioecy is an uncommon sexual system in which males, females, and hermaphrodites co-occur as three clearly different gender classes. The evolutionary stability of trioecy is unclear, but would depend on factors such as hermaphroditic sex allocation and rates of outcrossing vs. selfing. Here, trioecious populations of Mercurialis annua are described for the first time. We examined the frequencies of females, males and hermaphrodites across ten natural populations and evaluated the association between the frequency of females and plant densities. Previous studies have shown that selfing rates in this species are density-dependent and are reduced in the presence of males, which produce substantially more pollen than hermaphrodites. Accordingly, we examined the evolutionary stability of trioecy using an experiment in which we (a) indirectly manipulated selfing rates by altering plant densities and the frequency of males in a fully factorial manner across 20 experimental plots and (b) examined the effect of these manipulations on the frequency of the three sex phenotypes in the next generation of plants. In the parental generation, we measured the seed and pollen allocations of hermaphrodites and compared them with allocations by unisexual plants. In natural populations, females occurred at higher frequencies in denser patches, a finding consistent with our expectations. Under our experimental conditions, however, no combination of plant densities and male frequencies was associated with increased frequencies of females. Our results suggest that the factors that regulate female frequencies in trioecious populations of M. annua are independent of those regulating male frequencies (density), and that the stable co-existence of all three sex phenotypes within populations is unlikely.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Senecio hybrid zone on Mt Etna, Sicily, is characterized by steep altitudinal clines in quantitative traits and genetic variation. Such clines are thought to be maintained by a combination of “endogenous” selection arising from genetic incompatibilities and environment-dependent “exogenous” selection leading to local adaptation. Here, the hypothesis was tested that local adaptation to the altitudinal temperature gradient contributes to maintaining divergence between the parental species, S. chrysanthemifolius and S. aethnensis.
METHODS: Intra- and inter-population crosses were performed between five populations from across the hybrid zone and the germination and early seedling growth of the progeny were assessed.
KEY RESULTS: Seedlings from higher-altitude populations germinated better under low temperatures (9-13 °C) than those from lower altitude populations. Seedlings from higher-altitude populations had lower survival rates under warm conditions (25/15 °C) than those from lower altitude populations, but also attained greater biomass. There was no altitudinal variation in growth or survival under cold conditions (15/5 °C). Population-level plasticity increased with altitude. Germination, growth and survival of natural hybrids and experimentally generated F(1)s generally exceeded the worse-performing parent.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence was found for endogenous selection against hybrids but relatively clear evidence was found for divergence in seed and seedling traits, which is probably adaptive. The combination of low-temperature germination and faster growth in warm conditions might enable high-altitude S. aethnensis to maximize its growth during a shorter growing season, while the slower growth of S. chrysanthemifolius may be an adaptation to drought stress at low altitudes. This study indicates that temperature gradients are likely to be an important environmental factor generating and maintaining adaptive divergence across the Senecio hybrid zone on Mt Etna.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Changes in the sex allocation (i.e. in pollen versus seed production) of hermaphroditic plants often occur in response to the environment. In some homosporous ferns, gametophytes choose their gender in response to chemical cues sent by neighbours, such that spores develop as male gametophytes if they perceive a female or hermaphrodite nearby. Here it is considered whether a similar process might occur in the androdioecious angiosperm species Mercurialis annua, in which males co-occur with hermaphrodites; previous work on a Spanish population of M. annua found that individuals were more likely to develop as males at high density.
METHODS: Using a novel approach to treat plants with leachate from pots containing males or hermaphrodites of M. annua, the hypothesis that individuals assess their mating opportunities, and adjust their sex expression accordingly, was tested through an exchange of chemical cues through the soil.
KEY RESULTS: For the population under study, from Morocco, no evidence was found for soil-signal-dependent sex expression: neither sex ratios nor sex allocation differed among experimental treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: The results imply either that the Moroccan population under study behaves differently from that previously studied in Spain (pointing to potential geographical variation in plasticity for sex expression), or that our method failed to capture the signals used by M. annua for adjustment of sex expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The study of local adaptation in plant reproductive traits has received substantial attention in short-lived species, but studies conducted on forest trees are scarce. This lack of research on long-lived species represents an important gap in our knowledge, because inferences about selection on the reproduction and life history of short-lived species cannot necessarily be extrapolated to trees. This study considers whether the size for first reproduction is locally adapted across a broad geographical range of the Mediterranean conifer species Pinus pinaster. In particular, the study investigates whether this monoecious species varies genetically among populations in terms of whether individuals start to reproduce through their male function, their female function or both sexual functions simultaneously. Whether differences among populations could be attributed to local adaptation across a climatic gradient is then considered.
METHODS: Male and female reproduction and growth were measured during early stages of sexual maturity of a P. pinaster common garden comprising 23 populations sampled across the species range. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess genetic variability of early reproductive life-history traits. Environmental correlations with reproductive life-history traits were tested after controlling for neutral genetic structure provided by 12 nuclear simple sequence repeat markers.
KEY RESULTS: Trees tended to reproduce first through their male function, at a size (height) that varied little among source populations. The transition to female reproduction was slower, showed higher levels of variability and was negatively correlated with vegetative growth traits. Several female reproductive traits were correlated with a gradient of growth conditions, even after accounting for neutral genetic structure, with populations from more unfavourable sites tending to commence female reproduction at a lower individual size.
CONCLUSIONS: The study represents the first report of genetic variability among populations for differences in the threshold size for first reproduction between male and female sexual functions in a tree species. The relatively uniform size at which individuals begin reproducing through their male function probably represents the fact that pollen dispersal is also relatively invariant among sites. However, the genetic variability in the timing of female reproduction probably reflects environment-dependent costs of cone production. The results also suggest that early sex allocation in this species might evolve under constraints that do not apply to other conifers.},

abstract = {1. Wind pollination is thought to have evolved in response to selection for mechanisms to promote pollination success, when animal pollinators become scarce or unreliable. We might thus expect wind-pollinated plants to be less prone to pollen limitation than their insect-pollinated counterparts. Yet, if pollen loads on stigmas of wind-pollinated species decline with distance from pollen donors, seed set might nevertheless be pollen-limited in populations of plants that cannot self-fertilize their progeny, but not in self-compatible hermaphroditic populations.2. Here, we test this hypothesis by comparing pollen limitation between dioecious and hermaphroditic (monoecious) populations of the wind-pollinated herb Mercurialis annua.3. In natural populations, seed set was pollen-limited in low-density patches of dioecious, but not hermaphroditic, M. annua, a finding consistent with patterns of distance-dependent seed set by females in an experimental array. Nevertheless, seed set was incomplete in both dioecious and hermaphroditic populations, even at high local densities. Further, both factors limited the seed set of females and hermaphrodites, after we manipulated pollen and resource availability in a common garden experiment.4. Synthesis. Our results are consistent with the idea that pollen limitation plays a role in the evolution of combined vs. separate sexes in M. annua. Taken together, they point to the potential importance of pollen transfer between flowers on the same plant (geitonogamy) by wind as a mechanism of reproductive assurance and to the dual roles played by pollen and resource availability in limiting seed set. Thus, seed set can be pollen-limited in sparse populations of a wind-pollinated species, where mates are rare or absent, having potentially important demographic and evolutionary implications.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Male-biased sex allocation commonly occurs in wind-pollinated hermaphroditic plants, and is often positively associated with size, notably in terms of height. Currently, it is not well established whether a corresponding pattern holds for dioecious plants: do males of wind-pollinated species exhibit greater reproductive allocation than females? Here, sexual dimorphism is investigated in terms of life history trade-offs in a dioecious population of the wind-pollinated ruderal herb Mercurialis annua.Methods The allocation strategies of males and females grown under different soil nutrient availability and competitive (i.e. no, male or female competitor) regimes were compared.Key Results Male reproductive allocation increased disproportionately with biomass, and was greater than that of females when grown in rich soils. Sexual morphs differentially adjusted their reproductive allocation in response to local environmental conditions. In particular, males reduced their reproductive allocation in poor soils, whereas females increased theirs, especially when competing with another female rather than growing alone. Finally, males displayed smaller above-ground vegetative sizes than females, but neither nutrient availability nor competition had a strong independent effect on relative size disparities between the sexes.Conclusions Selection appears to favour plasticity in reproductive allocation in dioecious M. annua, thereby maintaining a relatively constant size hierarchy between sexual morphs. In common with other dioecious species, there seems to be little divergence in the niches occupied by males and females of M. annua.},

abstract = {Gender-dimorphic species often display a degree of sexual dimorphism in terms of life-history traits, yet little is known about dimorphism in androdioecious plants. Here we investigate sexual dimorphism in an androdioecious population of the wind-pollinated herb Mercurialis annua by comparing the resource allocation strategies of males and hermaphrodites grown under different nutrient-availability and competitive regimes. We found that males displayed smaller aboveground vegetative sizes than did hermaphrodites, but neither soil nutrient availability nor competition had a strong independent effect on their relative sizes. Plants adjusted their relative reproductive investment in response to nutrient availability. Specifically, hermaphrodites increased their reproductive allocation when growing in poor soils, whereas males displayed the opposite response. Finally, hermaphrodites were strongly female biased in their sex allocation, and this was more pronounced in nutrient-poor soils. To conclude, sexual dimorphism in androdioecious M. annua shares many features with dioecious and gynodioecious species, particularly wind-pollinated herbs. However, the direction of sex-allocation reaction norms displayed by hermaphrodites of M. annua differs from that documented for several insect-pollinated gynodioecious species, hinting at the importance of either the pollination mode or the sexual system as a context of selection shaping the reproductive strategy of plants with both male and female functions.},

abstract = {Background and Aims The frequency at which males can be maintained with hermaphrodites in androdioecious populations is predicted to depend on the selfing rate, because self-fertilization by hermaphrodites reduces prospective siring opportunities for males. In particular, high selfing rates by hermaphrodites are expected to exclude males from a population. Here, the first estimates are provided of the mating system from two wild hexaploid populations of the androdioecious European wind-pollinated plant M. annua with contrasting male frequencies.Methods Four diploid microsatellite loci were used to genotype 19-20 progeny arrays from two populations of M. annua, one with males and one without. Mating-system parameters were estimated using the program MLTR.Key Results Both populations had similar, intermediate outcrossing rates (t(m) = 0.64 and 0.52 for the population with and without males, respectively). The population without males showed a lower level of correlated paternity and biparental inbreeding and higher allelic richness and gene diversity than the population with males.Conclusions The results demonstrate the utility of new diploid microsatellite loci for mating system analysis in a hexaploid plant. It would appear that androdioecious M. annua has a mixed-mating system in the wild, an uncommon finding for wind-pollinated species. This study sets a foundation for future research to assess the relative importance of the sexual system, plant-density variation and stochastic processes for the regulation of male frequencies in M. annua over space and time.},

abstract = {For many applications in population genetics, codominant simple sequence repeats (SSRs) may have substantial advantages over dominant anonymous markers such as amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). In high polyploids, however, allele dosage of SSRs cannot easily be determined and alleles are not easily attributable to potentially diploidized loci. Here, we argue that SSRs may nonetheless be better than AFLPs for polyploid taxa if they are analyzed as effectively dominant markers because they are more reliable and more precise. We describe the transfer of SSRs developed for diploid Mercurialis huetii to the clonal dioecious M. perennis. Primers were tested on a set of 54 male and female plants from natural decaploid populations. Eight of 65 tested loci produced polymorphic fragments. Binary profiles from 4 different scoring routines were used to define multilocus lineages (MLLs). Allowing for fragment differences within 1 MLL, all analyses revealed the same 14 MLLs without conflicting with merigenet, sex, or plot assignment. For semiautomatic scoring, a combination of as few as 2 of the 4 most polymorphic loci resulted in unambiguous discrimination of clones. Our study demonstrates that microsatellite fingerprinting of polyploid plants is a cost efficient and reliable alternative to AFLPs, not least because fewer loci are required than for diploids.},

abstract = {Males of plants with separate sexes are often more prone to attack by herbivores than females. A common explanation for this pattern is that individuals with a greater male function suffer more from herbivory because they grow more quickly, drawing more heavily on resources for growth that might otherwise be allocated to defence. Here, we test this “faster-sex” hypothesis in a species in which males in fact grow more slowly than hermaphrodites, the wind-pollinated annual herb Mercurialis annua. We expected greater herbivory in the faster-growing hermaphrodites. In contrast, we found that males, the slower sex, were significantly more heavily eaten by snails than hermaphrodites. Our results thus reject the faster-sex hypothesis and point to the importance of a trade-off between defence and reproduction rather than growth.},

abstract = {Background and Aims The males and females of many dioecious plant species differ from one another in important life-history traits, such as their size. If male and female reproductive functions draw on different resources, for example, one should expect males and females to display different allocation strategies as they grow. Importantly, these strategies may differ not only between the two sexes, but also between plants of different age and therefore size. Results are presented from an experiment that asks whether males and females of Mercurialis annua, an annual plant with indeterminate growth, differ over time in their allocation of two potentially limiting resources (carbon and nitrogen) to vegetative (below-and above-ground) and reproductive tissues.Methods Comparisons were made of the temporal patterns of biomass allocation to shoots, roots and reproduction and the nitrogen content in the leaves between the sexes of M. annua by harvesting plants of each sex after growth over different periods of time.Key Results and Conclusions Males and females differed in their temporal patterns of allocation. Males allocated more to reproduction than females at early stages, but this trend was reversed at later stages. Importantly, males allocated proportionally more of their biomass towards roots at later stages, but the roots of females were larger in absolute terms. The study points to the important role played by both the timing of resource deployment and the relative versus absolute sizes of the sinks and sources in sexual dimorphism of an annual plant.},

abstract = {Gynodioecy, where females co-occur with hermaphrodites, is a relatively common sexual system in plants that is often the result of a genetic conflict between maternally inherited male sterility genes in the mitochondrial genome and the biparentally inherited male fertility restorer genes in the nucleus. Previous models have shown that nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy can be maintained under certain conditions by negative frequency-dependent selection, but the effect of other evolutionary processes such as genetic drift and population subdivision is only partially understood. Here, we investigate the joint effects of frequency-dependent selection, drift, and migration through either pollen or seeds on the maintenance of nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy in a subdivided population. We find that the combination of drift and selection causes the loss of gynodioecy under scenarios that would maintain it under the influence of selection alone, and that both seed and, more surprisingly, pollen flow can maintain the polymorphism. In particular, although pollen flow could not avoid the loss of cytoplasmic polymorphism within demes, it allowed the maintenance of nuclear-cytoplasmic polymorphism at the metapopulation level.},

abstract = {1. Species of the dioecious South African plant genus Leucadendron vary strikingly in their degree of sexual dimorphism, with males of dimorphic species typically possessing more and thinner branches and smaller leaves than the corresponding females.2. Many Leucadendron species are serotinous, with females of serotinous species maintaining seeds in transpiring cones for a number of years. Since cones must be kept alive, serotinous females presumably incur higher costs in terms of water loss than non-serotinous females and, particularly, males. Given that branching architecture is known to affect water conductance, with less resistance in less highly branched plants, we predicted a positive correlation between the degree of serotiny in a species and sexual dimorphism in branching.3. We tested the effect of serotiny and several other factors on the degree of sexual dimorphism in Leucadendron by conducting a comparative analysis of variation across 49 species using phylogenetic regression.4. There was a strong positive association between the degree of serotiny and sexual dimorphism. This association is consistent with the idea that the costs of maintaining cones may select females to be less highly branched than males.5. Synthesis. Serotiny is a strategy of maternal care that contributes to offspring survival after seed maturation. We found that, in Leucadendron, the evolution of increased serotiny corresponds with the evolution of more marked sexual dimorphism. This study exposes a hitherto unidentified association between sexual dimorphism and maternal care in plants and points to a possible additional reproductive burden carried by serotinous plants compared with those that release their seeds at maturity.},

abstract = {Mercurialis annua is a wind-pollinated annual showing a remarkable sexual-system variation, with hexaploid populations being either monoecious or androdioecious. Hexaploid M. annua is most likely a product of hybridization between diploid M. huetii and tetraploid M. annua; therefore, we developed microsatellite loci by isolating simple sequence repeat (SSR) sequences from the diploid progenitor, cross-amplification tests in M. huetii/M. annua species complex followed by selection of loci amplifying only in M. huetii and hexaploid M. annua, and testing polymorphism in 1 hexaploid population. This protocol resulted in 10 unlinked, polymorphic loci amplifying 4-10 alleles per locus. Due to specific amplification of the diploid part of the genome originating from M. huetii, these loci produce codominantly scored, diploid data for allohexaploid species, thereby simplifying data collection and subsequent analyses. Sequencing of the hexaploid polymerase chain reaction product for all 10 loci and aligning it with M. huetii SSR library sequence confirmed orthology of the characterized loci. Inheritance tests in 4 hexaploid crosses confirmed diploid Mendelian segregation of the new loci.},

Previous work showed that this colonisation resulted in a decrease of phenotypic and genetic diversity from the core in North Africa towards the distribution margins of M. annua in north-eastern and north-western Spain. Methods: Seeds were sampled from 20 populations located across the hexaploid range of M. annua. Patterns of phenotypic and genetic differentiation among experimentally grown populations were analysed and compared between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Results: The level of phenotypic and genetic differentiation among populations in the expanded range of the Iberian Peninsula was similar to that in the core range in North Africa. Conclusions: Our findings imply that the observed effects of range expansion on genetic differentiation may be independent of the effects on genetic diversity. They point to the importance of taking both historic and contemporary processes of migration into account when predicting the results of range expansion.},

abstract = {Males and females of dioecious plants often differ in morphological, physiological and life-history traits, probably as a result of their different requirements for reproduction. We found that the growth and reproductive effort of individuals of the dioecious herb Mercurialis annua depended on whether males or females had been growing in the soil previously. This suggests that males and females of M. annua differentially modify the soil in which they are growing. Our study indicates that sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants can give rise to increased environmental heterogeneity as a consequence of sex-specific niche modification.},

abstract = {Inbreeding depression has important implications for a wide range of biological phenomena, such as inbreeding avoidance, the evolution and maintenance of sexual systems and extinction rates of small populations. Previous investigations have asked how inbreeding depression evolves in single and subdivided populations through the fixation of deleterious mutations as a result of drift, as well as through the expression of deleterious mutations segregating in a population. These studies have focused on the effects of mutation and selection at single loci, or at unlinked loci. Here, we used simulations to investigate the evolution of genetic load and inbreeding depression due to multiple partially linked loci in metapopulations. Our results indicate that the effect of linkage depends largely on the kinds of deleterious alleles involved. For weakly deleterious and partially recessive mutations, the speed of mutation accumulation at segregating loci in a random-mating subdivided population of a given structure tends to be retarded by increased recombination between adjacent loci - although the highest numbers of fixation of slightly recessive mutant alleles were for low but finite recombination rates. Although linkage had a relatively minor effect on the evolution of metapopulations unless very low values of recombination were assumed, close linkage between adjacent loci tended to enhance population structure and population turnover. Finally, within-deme inbreeding depression, between-deme inbreeding depression and heterosis generally increased with decreased recombination rates. Moreover, increased selfing reduced the effective amount of recombination, and hence the effects of tight linkage on metapopulation genetic structure were decreased with increasing selfing. In contrast, linkage had little effect on the fate of lethal and highly recessive alleles. We compare our simulation results with predictions made by models that ignore the complexities of recombination.},

abstract = {In a metapopulation, the process of recurrent local extinction and recolonization gives rise to an age structure among demes. Recently established demes will tend to differ from older demes in terms of the levels of genetic diversity found within them and the way this diversity is distributed among demes in the same and different ages. The effects of population turnover on average levels of genetic diversity among demes in a metapopulation have been the focus of much attention, both for neutral and nonneutral loci, but much less is known about the distribution of nonneutral genetic diversity among demes of different ages. In this paper, we used computer simulations to study the distribution of genetic load, inbreeding depression and heterosis in an age-structured metapopulation. We found that, for mildly deleterious mutations, within-deme inbreeding depression increased, whereas heterosis and genetic load decreased with deme age following severe colonization bottlenecks. In contrast, recessive lethal alleles tended to be purged during colonization, with older populations showing higher genetic load and higher within-deme inbreeding depression. Heterosis caused by recessive lethal alleles and resulting from gene flow among different demes tended to be greatest for young demes, because the mutations responsible tended to be purged in the first few generations after colonization, but its effects increased again as populations grow older as a result of immigration. Our results point to a need for estimates of genetic diversity, genetic load, within-deme inbreeding depression and heterosis in demes of different age classes separately.},

Here, we compare northern and southern populations of the introduced species Senecio squalidus in Britain; S. squalidus has been in southern Britain for approximately 200 years and reached Scotland only about 50 years ago. We conducted common garden experiments at sites in the north and south of the species’ range in Britain. We also conducted glasshouse and growth chamber experiments to test the hypothesis that southern genotypes flower later, are more drought-tolerant, germinate and establish better at warmer temperatures, and are less sensitive to cold stress than their more northern counterparts. Results from the common garden experiments are largely consistent with the hypothesis of rapid adaptive divergence of populations of the species within the introduced range, with genotypes typically showing a home-site advantage. Results from the glasshouse and growth chamber experiments demonstrate adaptive divergence in ability to tolerate drought stress and high temperatures, as well as in phenology. In particular, southern genotypes were more tolerant of dry conditions and high temperatures and they flowered later than northern genotypes. Our results show that rapid local adaptation can occur in alien species, and they have implications for our understanding of the ecological genetics of range expansion of introduced weeds.},

abstract = {The optimal deployment of reproductive resources by hermaphrodites to male versus female function (i.e., their sex allocation) depends directly on opportunities for mating. If hermaphrodites occur among females, selection should favor those with a male-biased allocation because increased male allocation enhances siring success when eggs are abundant. Similarly, when hermaphrodites co-occur with males, selection should favor those that bias their allocation toward their female function. We tested these predictions by allowing hermaphrodites of the plant Mercurialis annua to evolve in either the presence or absence of males. In the presence of males, hermaphrodites did not evolve, probably because they were already strongly female biased in the base population. However, hermaphrodites mating in the absence of males evolved greater male allocation, as predicted. Our results provide the first demonstration of an evolutionary response to the frequency of unisexuals in hermaphroditic sex allocation, and they verify the quantitative phase predicted by models for the transition between hermaphroditism and dioecy.},

However, very little is known about the levels of inbreeding depression in dioecious species, obviously because it is difficult to self-fertilize males or females. We overcame this problem by clonally propagating males from lineages in a dioecious metapopulation of the European annual plant Mercurialis annua, feminizing some of them and crossing the feminized with the unfeminized clones. Using this method, we compared the fitness of selfed vs outcrossed progeny under field conditions in Spain, where this species grows naturally. Multiplicative inbreeding depression (based on seed germination, early and late survival, seed mass and pollen viability) ranged from -0.69 to 0.82, with a mean close to zero. We consider possible explanations for both the low mean and high variance in inbreeding depression in M. annua, and we discuss the implications of our results for the maintenance of dioecy over hermaphroditism.},

Most such investigations have been unsystematic, devoid of testable theoretical predictions and, ultimately, unconvincing. A recent study, of magnetic responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, however, stands out; it has a clear hypothesis-that seedling growth is magnetically sensitive as a result of photoinduced radical-pair reactions in cryptochrome photoreceptors-tested by measuring several cryptochrome-dependent responses, all of which proved to be enhanced in a magnetic field of intensity 500 muT. The potential importance of this study in the debate on putative effects of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields on human health prompted us to subject it to the “gold standard” of independent replication. With experimental conditions chosen to match those of the original study, we have measured hypocotyl lengths and anthocyanin accumulation for Arabidopsis seedlings grown in a 500 microT magnetic field, with simultaneous control experiments at 50 microT. Additionally, we have determined hypocotyl lengths of plants grown in 50 microT, 1 mT and approximately 100 mT magnetic fields (with zero-field controls), measured gene (CHS, HY5 and GST) expression levels, investigated blue-light intensity effects and explored the influence of sucrose in the growth medium. In no case were consistent, statistically significant magnetic field responses detected.},

He recognized that many of the intricacies of floral morphology had been shaped by natural selection in favour of outcrossing, and he clearly established the deleterious effects of self-fertilization on progeny.

Here, I briefly review these contributions to our understanding of plant reproduction. I then suggest that investigating two very different sexual systems, one in plants and the other in animals, would throw further light on the long-term implications of a commitment to reproduction exclusively by selfing.},

By contrast, hybrid zones have repeatedly provided outstanding material for the study of evolution: they allow us to study ecological and genomic differences between recently diverged taxa; and they bring into sharp focus the interplay between migration, selection, recombination and drift. A new theoretical analysis now demonstrates that hybrid-zone dynamics provide a counterintuitive explanation for how a new chromosomal sex-determination system can evolve and spread across the landscape, displacing the ancestral system, even though it would be eliminated by natural selection in a single isolated population. This work thus provides a provocative resolution to a conundrum that has puzzled cytogeneticists and evolutionary biologists for years.},

abstract = {Many species expanded their geographic ranges from core “refugium” populations when the global climate warmed after the Pleistocene. The bottlenecks that occur during such range expansions diminish genetic variation in marginal populations, rendering them less responsive to selection. Here, we show that range expansion also strongly depletes inbreeding depression. We compared inbreeding depression among 20 populations across the expanded range of a common European plant, and found that marginal populations had greatly reduced inbreeding depression. Similar patterns were also revealed by multilocus computer simulations. Low inbreeding depression is predicted to ease conditions for the evolution of self-fertilization, and selfing is known to be particularly frequent in marginal populations. Therefore, our findings expose a remarkable aspect of evolution at range margins, where a history of expansion can reverse the direction of selection on the mating system, providing a parsimonious explanation for the high incidence of selfing in marginal populations.},

In androdioecious plant populations, where males co-occur with hermaphrodites, the sex ratio depends on the rate of self-fertilization by hermaphrodites and on the relative pollen production of males versus hermaphrodites. Here, we report evolutionary changes in the sex ratio from experimental mating arrays of the androdioecious plant Mercurialis annua. We found that the progeny sex ratio depended strongly on density, with fewer males in the progeny of plants grown under low density. This occurred in part because of a plastic adjustment in pollen production by hermaphrodites, which produced more pollen when grown at low density than at high density. Our results provide support for the prediction that environmental conditions govern sex ratios through their effects on the relative fertility of unisexual versus hermaphrodite individuals.},

abstract = {Background and Aims Heterodichogamy (a dimorphic breeding system comprising protandrous and protogynous individuals) is a potential starting point in the evolution of dioecy from hermaphroditism. In the genus Acer, previous work suggests that dioecy evolved from heterodichogamy through an initial spread of unisexual males. Here, the question is asked as to whether the different morphs in Acer opalus, a species in which males co-exist with heterodichogamous hermaphrodites, differ in various components of male in fitness.Methods Several components of male fertility were analysed. Pollination rates in the male phase were recorded across one flowering period. Pollen viability was compared among morphs through hand pollinations both with pollen from a single sexual morph and also simulating a situation of pollen competition; in the latter experiment, paternity was assessed with microsatellite markers. It was also determined whether effects of genetic relatedness between pollen donors and recipients could influence the siring success. Finally, paternal effects occurring beyond the fertilization process were tested for by measuring the height reached by seedlings with different sires over three consecutive growing seasons.Key Results The males and protandrous morphs had higher pollination rates than the protogynous morph, and the seedlings they sired grew taller. No differences in male fertility were found between males and protandrous individuals. Departures from random mating due to effects of genetic relatedness among sires and pollen recipients were also ruled out.Conclusions Males and protandrous individuals are probably better sires than protogynous individuals, as shown by the higher pollination rates and the differential growth of the seedlings sired by these morphs. In contrast, the fertility of males was not higher than the male fertility of the protandrous morph. While the appearance of males in sexually specialized heterodichogamous populations is possible, even in the absence of a fitness advantage, it is not clear that males can be maintained at an evolutionary equilibrium with two classes of heterodichogamous hermaphrodites.},

abstract = {In sexually polymorphic species, the morphs are maintained by frequency-dependent selection through disassortative mating. In heterodichogamous populations in which disassortative mating occurs between the protandrous and protogynous morphs, a decrease in female fitness in one morph is hypothesized to drive sexual specialization in the other morph, resulting in dimorphic populations. We test these ideas in a population of the heterodichogamous species, Acer opalus. We assessed both prospective gender of individuals in terms of their allocations and actual parentage using microsatellites; we found that most matings in A. opalus occur disassortatively. We demonstrate that the protogynous morph is maintained by frequency-dependent selection, but that maintenance of males versus protandrous individuals depends on their relative siring success, which changes yearly. Seeds produced later in the reproductive season were smaller than those produced earlier; this should compromise reproduction through ovules in protandrous individuals, rendering them male biased in gender. Time-dependent gender and paternity analyses indicate that the sexual morphs are specialized in their earlier sexual functions, mediated by the seasonal decrease in seed size. Our results confirm that mating patterns are context-dependent and change seasonally, suggesting that sexual specialization can be driven by seasonal effects on fitness gained through one of the two sexual functions.},

abstract = {Females tend to be smaller than males in woody dioecious plant species, but they tend to be larger in herbs. The smaller size of females in woody species has been attributed to higher reproductive costs, yet no satisfactory explanation has been provided for their larger size in herbs. Because herbs have higher nitrogen concentrations in their tissues than woody plants, and because pollen is particularly rich in nitrogen, we predicted that male growth would be more compromised by reproduction than female growth. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three experiments on the annual dioecious herb Mercurialis annua. First, we compared the timing of reproduction between males and females and found that males started flowering earlier than females; early flowering is expected to compromise growth more than later flowering. Second, we compared plants allowed to flower with those prevented from flowering by experimental debudding and found that males incurred a higher reproductive cost than females in terms of both biomass and, particularly, nitrogen. Third, we grew plants under varying levels of nitrogen availability and found that although sexual size dimorphism was unaffected by nitrogen, females, but not males, decreased their relative allocation to both roots and reproduction under high nitrogen availability. We propose that males deal with the high cost of pollen production in terms of nitrogen by allocating biomass to nitrogen-harvesting roots, whereas females pay for carbon-rich seeds and fruits by investing in photosynthetic organs. Sexual dimorphism would thus seem to be the outcome of allocation to above- versus below-ground sinks that supply resources (carbon versus nitrogen) limiting the female and male reproduction differentially.},

abstract = {Phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies suggest that a majority of asexual organisms are evolutionarily recent offshoots of extant sexual taxa and that old clonal lineages tend to be isolated from their sexual and younger asexual counterparts. These observations have often been interpreted as support for the long-term disadvantages of asexuality resulting from the mechanisms of clonal decay. Although clonal decay is likely to be an important mechanism that limits the temporal and spatial distribution of asexual lineages, we argue here that contemporary phylogenetic analyses, which are mostly restricted to simple comparisons of “recent” and “ancient” clones, need to be tested against an appropriate null model of neutrality. We use computer simulations to show that many empirical observations of the distribution of asexuality do not in fact reject a null model of the neutral turnover of clones spawned by sexual relatives. In particular, neutral clonal turnover results in qualitatively similar pattern of clonal spatial distribution and age structure, as does a process that includes clonal decay. Although there are important quantitative differences between predictions made by the two models, we show that published empirical data are still inadequate to distinguish between them. Further work on sexual-asexual complexes is therefore required before clonal turnover can be rejected as a parsimonious explanation of the spatial distribution and age structure of asexual lineages.},

abstract = {Androdioecy, where males co-occur with hermaphrodites, is a rare sexual system in plants and animals. It has a scattered phylogenetic distribution, but it is common and has persisted for long periods of evolutionary time in branchiopod crustaceans. An earlier model of the maintenance of males with hermaphrodites in this group, by Otto et al. (1993), considered the importance of male-hermaphrodite encounter rates, sperm limitation, male versus hermaphrodite viability and inbreeding depression suffered by selfed progeny. Here I advance this model in two ways: (1) by exploring the conditions that would allow the invasion of hermaphrodites into a dioecious population and that of females into an androdioecious population; and (2) by incorporating a term that accounts for the potential effects of genetic load linked to a dominant hermaphrodite-determining allele in androdioecious populations. The new model makes plausible sense of observations made in populations of the species Eulimnadia texana, one of a number of related species whose common ancestor evolved hermaphroditism (and androdioecy) from dioecy. In particular, it offers an explanation for the long evolutionary persistence of androdioecy in branchiopods and suggests reasons for why dioecy has not re-evolved in the clade. Finally, it provides a rather unusual illustration of the implications of the degeneration of loci linked to a sex-determining locus.},

abstract = {Evolutionary transitions between hermaphroditism and dioecy have occurred numerous times in the land plants. We briefly review the factors thought to be responsible for these transitions, and we provide a synthesis of what has been learned from recent studies of the annual herb Mercurialis annua, in which dioecy (males and females), monoecy (functional hermaphrodites), and androdioecy (males and hermaphrodites) occur in different parts of its geographic range. Previous research on M. annua has revealed the importance of genome duplication and hybridization in the origin of much of the observed variation. Here we show, however, that spatial transitions in the sexual system also occur within the same ploidy level. In particular, we present an analysis, using flow cytometry data, of ploidy variation across a previously unstudied transition between hermaphroditism and androdioecy, in which we find that the sexual-system transition is uncoupled from the shift in ploidy levels. We review recent research that shows that such transitions between sexual systems in M. annua are consistent with differential selection at the regional level for reproductive assurance during colonization. We also present new experimental data that highlight both the importance of the resource status of plants and that of their local mating context in regulating gender strategies and sex ratios. The studies reviewed and the new results presented emphasize the role that shifts in the ecological and genetic context of plant populations may play in causing transitions between sexual systems.},

abstract = {Plant polyploid complexes provide useful model systems for distinguishing between adaptive and nonadaptive causes of parapatric distributions in closely related lineages. Polyploidy often gives rise to morphological and physiological changes, which may be adaptive to different environments, but separate distributions may also be maintained by reproductive interference caused by postzygotic reproductive isolation. Here, we test the hypothesis that diploid and descendent polyploid races of the wind-pollinated herb Mercurialis annua, which are found in parapatry over an environmental gradient in northeast Spain, are differentiated in their ecophysiology and life history. We also ask whether any such differences represent adaptations to their different natural environments. On the basis of a series of reciprocal transplant experiments in the field, and experiments under controlled conditions, we found that diploid and polyploid populations of M. annua are ecologically differentiated, but that they do not show local adaptation; rather, the diploids have higher fitness than the polyploids across both diploid- and polyploid-occupied regions. In fact, diploids are currently displacing polyploids by advancing south on two separate fronts in Spain, and previous work has shown that this displacement is being driven to a large extent by asymmetrical pollen swamping. Our results here suggest that ecophysiological superiority of the diploids may also be contributing to their expansion.},

abstract = {The parapatric distribution of genetically divergent lineages in hybrid zones can be maintained by ecological differences (dispersal-independent “ecotonal” hybrid zones), by frequency- and density-dependent interference when they intermingle and mate (dispersal-dependent “tension” hybrid zones), or by both processes acting together. One potentially important ecological factor that has received little theoretical attention is gradients in habitat disturbance. Such gradients may be particularly important in contact zones in which the interacting lineages differ in their sexual system (e.g., self-fertile versus obligately outcrossing) because self-fertility promotes the colonization of open patches. Here we use a spatially explicit metapopulation model to examine the dynamics of a dispersal-dependent ecotonal hybrid zone across a gradient in the rate of habitat disturbance, where competing lineages differ in their sexual system. We found that self-fertility promoted the maintenance of one lineage over its outcrossing counterpart at high extinction rates, predominantly because self-fertility confers reproductive assurance. Additionally, greater seed and pollen production promoted a lineage’s persistence by reducing the seed fertility of its counterpart through hybridization. Our results draw attention to the joint effects of ecological and endogenous selection in regulating the location of hybrid zones. Our study also casts new light on the maintenance of the parapatric distribution of incompatible lineages of Spanish populations of the plant Mercurialis annua. In particular, we expect the rate of movement of a contact zone in eastern Spain to increase as it moves further south, contrary to earlier predictions.},

abstract = {Models of mating-system evolution emphasize the importance of frequency-dependent interactions among mating partners. It is also known that outcross siring success and the selfing rate in self-compatible hermaphrodites can be density dependent. Here, we use array experiments to show that the mating system (i.e., the outcrossing rate) and the siring success of morphs with divergent sex allocation strategies are both density dependent and frequency dependent in androdioecious populations of the wind-pollinated, annual plant Mercurialis annua. In particular, the outcrossing rate is a decreasing function of the mean interplant distance, regulated by a negative exponential pollen fall-off curve. Our results indicate that pollen dispersed from a male inflorescence are over 60% more likely to sire outcrossed progeny than equivalent pollen dispersed from hermaphrodites, likely due to the fact that males, but not hermaphrodites, disperse their pollen from erect inflorescence stalks. Because of this difference, and because males of M. annua produce much more pollen than hermaphrodites, the presence of males in the experimental arrays reduced both the selfing rate and the outcross siring success of hermaphrodites. We use our results to infer a density threshold below which males are unable to persist with hermaphrodites but above which they can invade hermaphroditic populations. We discuss our findings in the context of a metapopulation model, in which males can only persist in well-established populations but are excluded from small, sparse populations, for example, in the early stages of colonization.},

Specifically, we predicted that monomorphic, hermaphroditic populations, which are thought to have evolved under selection for reproductive assurance during repeated bouts of colonization, would be smaller and their suitable habitat less frequently occupied than dimorphic populations, where males co-occur with either females or hermaphrodites. We show that both of these predictions are upheld.

abstract = {Interspecific hybridization is recognized as a potentially destructive process that represents a major threat to biodiversity. The rate of population displacement by hybridization can be rapid, but underlying mechanisms are often obscure. One hypothesis is that a species may be driven to extinction by interspecific gene flow, or pollen swamping, when hybrids are inviable or sterile. Here, we document the rapid movement of two zones of contact between monoecious hexaploid and dioecious diploid populations of the wind-pollinated plant Mercurialis annua (Euphorbiaceae) in northeastern and northwestern Spain, where diploids have displaced hexaploids by about 80 and 200 km, respectively, over a period of four decades. By using experimental mating arrays, we show that hybridization is highly asymmetrical in favor of the diploids, mainly because they disperse substantially more pollen, as expected in a comparison between an obligate outcrosser and a facultative selfer. Self-fertilization, which is expected to reduce the proportion of sterile hybrids produced in mixed ploidy populations, allowed the hexaploids to avoid the effects of pollen swamping only slightly, and in a density-dependent manner. Our results thus provide a mechanistic explanation for the rapid movement of both contact zones of M. annua in Spain.},

Our results indicate that hexaploid populations of M. annua, in which the rare sexual system androdioecy is common (the occurrence of males and hermaphrodites) is of allopolyploid origin involving hybridization between an autotetraploid lineage of M. annua and the related diploid species M. huetii. We discuss the possibility that androdioecy may have evolved as a result of hybridization between dioecious M. huetii and monoecious tetraploid M. annua, an event that brought together the genes for specialist males with those for hermaphrodites.},

Here we use patterns of genetic diversity to provide such a test in the Mercurialis annua species complex, which spans the range of systems from self-compatible monoecy through androdioecy to dioecy. This variation has been hypothesized to result from differing patterns of metapopulation turnover and recolonization. Because monoecy should be favored during colonization, androdioecy and dioecy will be maintained only in regions with low rates of local extinction and recolonization, and these differences should also be reflected in patterns of neutral genetic diversity. We show that monoecious populations of M. annua display lower within-population genetic diversity than androdioecious populations and higher genetic differentiation than dioecious and androdioecious populations, as predicted by metapopulation models. In contrast, regional diversity in M. annua appears to be primarily a product of postglacial range expansion from two refugia in the eastern and western Mediterranean Basin.},

abstract = {The analysis of genetic diversity within and between populations is a routine task in the study of diploid organisms. However, population genetic studies of polyploid organisms have been hampered by difficulties associated with scoring and interpreting molecular data. This occurs because the presence of multiple alleles at each locus often precludes the measurement of genotype or allele frequencies. In allopolyploids, the problem is compounded because genetically distinct isoloci frequently share alleles. As a result, analysis of genetic diversity patterns in allopolyploids has tended to rely on the interpretation of phenotype frequencies, which loses information available from allele composition. Here, we propose the use of a simple allelic-phenotype diversity statistic (H’) that measures diversity as the average number of alleles by which pairs of individuals differ. This statistic can be extended to a population differentiation measure (F’ST), which is analogous to FST. We illustrate the behaviour of these statistics using coalescent computer simulations that show that F’ST behaves in a qualitatively similar way to FST, thus providing a useful way to quantify population differentiation in allopolyploid species.},

abstract = {Several different pathways for the evolution of dioecy from hermaphroditism have been invoked and analyzed. These have largely considered either the spread of male- or female-sterility mutations in a monomorphic hermaphroditic population (i.e., the evolution of gynodioecy or androdioecy, respectively) or the gradual divergence in sex allocation of two classes of individuals, one that becomes increasingly male and the other that becomes increasingly female in functional gender (the paradioecy pathway). Here we assess the conditions under which male- or female-sterility mutations may invade and spread in a heterodichogamous population, that is, a dimorphic population composed of protandrous and protogynous individuals. Our model is formally applied to heterodichogamous populations, but the ideas we explore may also apply to the evolution of separate sexes in distylous species, where plants are either long- or short-styled. The model predicts that, under many circumstances, conditions for the evolution of gynodioecy and androdioecy in a heterodichogamous population are the same as those for their evolution from monomorphic populations. However, if one or the other of the two morphs are already somewhat specialized in their functional gender, as might occur if the quality or quantity of seed set is time dependent, the conditions for the invasion of males or females are relaxed. In particular, androdioecy can evolve more easily under such circumstances in heterodichogamous populations than in monomorphic hermaphroditic populations.},

abstract = {Colonisation plays a central role in both the initial occupancy of a region through range expansions as well as in metapopulations, where local extinctions are balanced by re-colonisations. In this paper, we review the effects that colonisation is expected to have on patterns of genetic variation within a species, and we draw attention to the possibility of interpreting these patterns as signatures of colonisation in the past. We briefly review theoretical predictions for the effect of colonisation on both neutral genetic diversity and on variation at genetic loci that regulate the sexual system of plant populations. The sexual system represents a particularly important trait in this context because it is affected by both selection during colonisation, and because it influences gene flow amongst populations. Finally, we introduce four case studies of plant species that show variation in their sexual systems that is consistent with theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {Ovule discounting denotes the reduction in the number of ovules available for cross-fertilization due to the interference of inferior pollen. Traditionally, ovule discounting has been discussed solely from the perspective of compromised outcrossing opportunities as a result of selfing, but the principle is more general. Here, we extend its applicability beyond the simple contrast between selfing and outcrossing by showing that, in the cryptically dioecious tree species Fraxinus ornus, ovule discounting through frequent outcrossing with inferior fathers also constitutes a substantial cost of mating. In F. ornus, hermaphrodites produce pollen capable of siring offspring, but these offspring are less viable than those sired by males and are inferred to produce few, if any, surviving progeny. In this paper, we used microsatellite markers to analyze the mating system and paternity in a wild population of F. ornus. We found that the effective number of sires per mother was low (N(ep) = 2.93 to 4.95), and that paternity was correlated among progeny sampled from the same mother, but not among progeny sampled from neighboring mothers. Despite the existence of a local spatial genetic structure (up to 30 m), we found no evidence of biparental inbreeding. There was negligible selfing by hermaphrodites, but they sired approximately one fourth of the seeds produced by other hermaphrodites. Given that these progeny are not inferred to reach reproductive maturity, this constitutes a substantial cost of ovule discounting in the broad sense. We discuss the possible reasons for why hermaphrodites invest resources into inferior pollen.},

abstract = {An important result of population genetics is that advantageous mutations will be fixed by selection in a population with a greater probability if they are dominant rather than recessive. This selective filter on new variants entering a population, termed “Haldane’s Sieve”, has hitherto been invoked to account for the greater role of dominant than completely recessive mutations in adaptive evolution. Here, we suggest that a process similar to Haldane’s Sieve will act on migrants into subpopulations of a metapopulation, and that the repeated action of Haldane’s Sieve on alleles maintained by frequency-dependent selection, such as those responsible for many plant reproductive polymorphisms, is expected to bias their frequency distribution in favour of dominant alleles. The genetic and phenotypic signatures left by these processes might provide additional indirect support for the contentious idea that metapopulation dynamics have had an important role in shaping the ecology and evolution of some plant species.},

abstract = {The evolutionary success of polyploidy most directly requires the ability of polyploid individuals to reproduce and transmit their genes to subsequent generations. As a result, the sexual system (i.e. the mating system and the sex allocation of a species) will necessarily play a key role in determining the fate of a new polyploid lineage. The effects of the sexual system on the evolution of polyploidy are complex and interactive. They include both aspects of the genetic system, the genetic load maintained in a population and the ecological context in which selection takes place. Here, we explore these complexities and review the empirical evidence for several potentially important genetic and ecological interactions between ploidy and the sexual system in plants. We place particular emphasis on work in our laboratory on the European annual plant Mercurialis annua, which offers promising scope for detailed investigations on this topic. M. annua forms a polyploid complex that varies in its sexual system from dioecy (separate sexes) through androdioecy (males and hermaphrodites) to functional hermaphroditism.},

abstract = {Natural selection operates on the mating strategies of hermaphrodites through their functional gender, i.e. their relative success as male versus female parents. Because functional gender will tend to be strongly influenced by sex allocation, it is often estimated in plants by counting seeds and pollen grains. However, a plant’s functional gender must also depend on the fate of the seeds and pollen grains it produces. We provide clear evidence of a paternal effect on the functional gender of a plant that is independent of the resources invested in pollen. In the Mediterranean tree Fraxinus ornus, males coexist with hermaphrodites that disperse viable pollen and that sire seeds; the population would thus appear to be functionally androdioecious. However, we found that seedlings sired by hermaphrodites grew significantly less well than those sired by males, suggesting that hermaphrodites may be functionally less male than they seem. The observed 1 : 1 sex ratios in F. ornus, which have hitherto been difficult to explain in the light of the seed-siring ability of hermaphrodites, support our interpretation that this species is cryptically dioecious. Our results underscore the importance of considering progeny quality when estimating gender, and caution against inferring androdioecy on the basis of a siring ability of hermaphrodites alone.},

One population was a seminatural stand, while the other was established by artificial propagation of genotypes sampled widely across Spain. The low seed set in both populations was due to both pre- and post-zygotic factors, the importance of which vary between genotypes. These factors included gynoecial malformations that produced a non-ovulated pistil, early gynoecial necrosis (i.e., necrosis before any opportunities for pollination), and seed abortion. Female sterility gave rise to two classes of individuals: trees that were largely female-sterile but dispersed normal quantities of viable pollen, and trees that dispersed both normal pollen and substantial numbers of seeds. Reduced production of protein-rich seeds may increase the resource availability for clonal propagation, helping to maintain female-sterile individuals with hermaphrodites.},

abstract = {Many species exist as metapopulations in balance between local population extinction and recolonization. The effect of these processes on average population differentiation, within-deme diversity, and species wide diversity has been considered previously. In this paper, coalescent simulations of Slatkin’s propagule-pool and migrant-pool models are used to characterize the distribution of neutral genetic diversity within demes (pi(S)), diversity in the metapopulation a whole (pi(T)), the ratio F(ST) = (pi(T) - pi(S))/pi(T), Tajima’s D statistic, and several ratios of gene-tree branch lengths. Using these distributions, power to detect differences in key metapopulation parameter values is determined under contrasting sampling regimes. The results indicate that it will be difficult to use sequence data from a single locus to detect a history of extinctions and recolonizations in a metapopulation because of high genealogical variance, the loss of diversity due to reductions in effective population size, and the fact that a genealogy of lineages from different demes under Slatkin’s model differs from a neutral coalescent only in its time scale. Genetic indices of gene-tree shape that capture the effects of extinction/recolonization on both external branches and the length of the genealogy as a whole will provide the best indication of metapopulation dynamics if several lineages are sampled from several different demes.},

Since then, several examples have been discovered in both plants and animals, and we are now in a position to reappraise theoretical work on the subject. Whereas early ideas were framed largely in terms of the invasion of males into hermaphroditic populations, all of the clearest examples of androdioecy now known appear to have evolved from dioecy. There are strong indications that this has occurred repeatedly as a result of the selection of self-fertile hermaphroditism for reproductive assurance during colonization. Male frequencies in these species are highly variable, self-fertilization in hermaphrodites is delayed, and mating opportunities appear to depend strongly on population density. Results from theoretical work on the evolution and maintenance of androdioecy in single populations and in metapopulations are summarized, and several case studies of androdioecious plants and animals are reviewed.},

Plant responses to different environments can provide evidence of such integration. We grew Mercurialis annua plants in high-density stands in high irradiance, in neutral shade, and in high red to far-red (R:FR) shade, resulting in environments of high irradiance, low R:FR; low irradiance, low R:FR; and low irradiance, high R:FR. We measured gas exchange, leaf morphology, stem elongation, and biomass traits and tested the prediction that traits within each functional group would show higher trait integration, as evidenced by high correlations among traits within environments, higher correlations of trait plasticity, and lower plasticity of trait correlations. Overall, we found evidence of only moderate integration for some groups of traits. Functionally related groups of traits, or pairs of traits, could be strongly integrated by one criterion but weakly integrated by another of the criteria. Stem elongation traits, though often observed to be strongly integrated in other taxa, showed little evidence of integration. Internode traits exhibited a novel pattern of responses to low R:FR, with increased elongation of the hypocotyl, decreased elongation of the first internode, and no change in the second internode. We propose that these responses to light are more likely to be the result of natural selection than the consequence of constraints imposed by pleiotropy.},

abstract = {The evolutionary dynamics of neutral alleles under the Wright-Fisher model are well understood. Similarly, the effect of population turnover on neutral genetic diversity in a metapopulation has attracted recent attention in theoretical studies. Here we present the results of computer simulations of a simple model that considers the effects of finite population size and metapopulation dynamics on a mating-system polymorphism involving selfing and outcrossing morphs. The details of the model are based on empirical data from dimorphic populations of the annual plant Eichhornia paniculata, but the results are also of relevance to species with density-dependent selfing rates in general. In our model, the prior selfing rate is determined by two alleles segregating at a single diploid locus. After prior selfing occurs, some remaining ovules are selfed through competing self-fertilisation in finite populations as a result of random mating among gametes. Fitness differences between the mating-system morphs were determined by inbreeding depression and pollen discounting in a context-dependent manner. Simulation results showed evidence of frequency dependence in the action of pollen discounting and inbreeding depression in finite populations. In particular, as a result of selfing in outcrossers through random mating among gametes, selfers experienced a “fixation bias” through drift, even when the mating-system locus was selectively neutral. In a metapopulation, high colony turnover generally favoured the fixation of the outcrossing morph, because inbreeding depression reduced opportunities for colony establishment by selfers through seed dispersal. Our results thus demonstrate that population size and metapopulation processes can lead to evolutionary dynamics involving pollen and seed dispersal that are not predicted for large populations with stable demography.},

Here I argue that androdioecy, a rare breeding system in which males co-occur with hermaphrodites, may evolve in a metapopulation under the joint action of local mate competition and Baker’s Law if rates of self-fertilisation decrease with increasing population size. The hypothesis makes several predictions regarding patterns of life-history and sex allocation that are borne out by recent observations of androdioecious species in several unrelated lineages of plants and animals.},

abstract = {Many species persist as a metapopulation under a balance between the local extinction of subpopulations or demes and their recolonization through dispersal from occupied patches. Here we review the growing body of literature dealing with the genetic consequences of such population turnover. We focus our attention principally on theoretical studies of a classical metapopulation with a “finite-island” model of population structure, rather than on “continent-island” models or “source-sink” models. In particular, we concern ourselves with the subset of geographically subdivided population models in which it is assumed that all demes are liable to extinction from time to time and that all demes receive immigrants. Early studies of the genetic effects of population turnover focused on population differentiation, such as measured by F(ST). A key advantage of F(ST) over absolute measures of diversity is its relative independence of the mutation process, so that different genes in the same species may be compared. Another advantage is that F(ST) will usually equilibrate more quickly following perturbations than will absolute levels of diversity. However, because F(ST) is a ratio of between-population differentiation to total diversity, the genetic effects of metapopulation processes may be difficult to interpret in terms of F(ST) on its own, so that the analysis of absolute measures of diversity in addition is likely to be informative. While population turnover may either increase or decrease F(ST), depending on the mode of colonization, recurrent extinction and recolonization is expected always to reduce levels of both within-population and species-wide diversity (piS and piT, respectively). One corollary of this is that piS cannot be used as an unbiased estimate of the scaled mutation rate, theta, as it can, with some assumptions about the migration process, in species whose demes do not fluctuate in size. The reduction of piT in response to population turnover reflects shortened mean coalescent times, although the distribution of coalescence times under extinction colonization equilibrium is not yet known. Finally, we review current understanding of the effect of metapopulation dynamics on the effective population size.},

However, it has been difficult to account for male frequencies previously documented for this species, which have frequently been higher than 0.5. Here we present sex-ratio data from 13 sites in Spain and Portugal that throw further light on the maintenance of androdioecy in P. angustifolia. The inferred proportion of males in these populations was around 0.3, substantially lower that 0.5 and concurring with theoretical predictions for androdioecy. Differences in the proportion of hermaphrodites in flower between “stressed” and “nonstressed” sites suggest the existence of an important life-history trade-off between fruit production and the rate at which plants recover from recurrent disturbances such as fire. The reduced frequency of flowering by hermaphrodites relative to males map help to explain the maintenance of androdioecy in this long-lived, woody species.},

abstract = {Many species exist as metapopulations in balance between local population extinction and recolonization, processes that may strongly affect the distribution of neutral genetic diversity within demes and in the metapopulation as a whole. In this paper we use both the infinite-alleles and the infinite-sites models to reframe Slatkin’s propagule-pool and migrant-pool models in terms of mean within-deme and among-deme genetic diversity; the infinite-sites model is particularly relevant to DNA sequence data. Population turnover causes a major reduction in neutral genetic diversity within demes, pi(S), and in the metapopulation as a whole, pi(T). This effect is particularly strong for propagule-pool colonization, in which colonists are drawn from a single extant deme. Because metapopulation dynamics affect both within-deme and total metapopulation diversity similarly, comparisons between species with different ecologies on the basis of ratios such as F-ST are difficult to interpret and absolute measures of divergence between populations should be used as well. Although the value of F-ST in a metapopulation with local extinction depends strongly on the mode of colonization, this has almost no effect on the numerator of the F-ST ratio, pi(T) - pi(S), so that F-ST is influenced mainly by the effect of the colonization mode on the denominator (pi(T)). Our results also indicate that it is inappropriate to use measures of average within-deme diversity in species with population turnover to estimate the scaled mutation rate, theta, because extinction can greatly reduce pi(S). Finally, we discuss the effect of population turnover on the effective size of a metapopulation.},

abstract = {MERCURIALIS ANNUA: is a ruderal of pan-European distribution. In southern Spain, southern Portugal and northern Morocco, males coexist with monoecious (cosex) individuals at frequencies which vary between zero and about 30 per cent. Here, I report the results of two glasshouse experiments which aimed to characterize the mode of sex determination in one such androdioecious population. In a breeding experiment, cosexes isolated from males produced only cosexual progeny, whereas those allowed to mate with males produced both cosexual and male offspring. The results are consistent with a single-locus model of sex inheritance, with maleness determined by a dominant allele. In a density experiment, the frequency of males correlated positively with density, confirming field observations. Differential mortality or germination between the sexes was excluded by experimental design, so that the result supports the hypothesis of density- dependent gender choice. A negative correlation between density and the proportion of “late cosexes” (males which turned cosexual late in their development), and the lack of any differences in the proportion of pure (unchanged) cosexes between density, suggest that only males were capable of sex change. This interpretation is consistent with the results of the breeding experiment, in which late cosexes occurred only in the offspring of cosexes allowed to mate with males. I argue that these findings help to explain the maintenance of androdioecy in M. annua.},

abstract = {Males and females are at a selective disadvantage relative to hermaphrodites (cosexuals) in species with a colonizing habit, as only cosexuals are able to establish new colonies on their own. The implications of this disadvantage are assessed by means of a computer model of metapopulation dynamics, in which individual colonies are established through different rates of immigration and suffer different rates of local extinction. Results are given for simulations of an island model, a stepping-stone model, and for a partial analysis of the island model with simplifying assumptions. It is shown that: (1) unisexual frequencies in a metapopulation can be reasonably approximated by a linear function of the logarithm of the ratio of the immigration rate to the colony extinction rate; (2) metapopulation dynamics favor the maintenance of females (gynodioecy) over males (androdioecy) with cosexuals when they would otherwise be equally likely in a panmictic situation; (3) the way in which extinction and immigration rates affect unisexual frequencies at metapopulation equilibrium interacts with whether sterility is determined by a dominant or a recessive allele; and (4) unisexual frequencies are affected in a qualitatively similar way by the dynamics of a metapopulation when cosexuals are self-incompatible to when they are self-compatible, although only in the former case are high frequencies of unisexuals maintained when extinction and colonization rates approach the threshold at which the metapopulation goes extinct. These results are discussed with reference to existing data from species with nuclear male or female sterility.},

abstract = {1 Strong spatial heterogeneity in male frequencies and allocation to male and female function was found within and between androdioecious populations of the wind-pollinated ruderal Mercurialis annua in south-western Spain.
2 Sex determination is largely genetic and the constancy from year to year of the frequency of males in small quadrats suggests that seed and pollen dispersal are very limited.
3 Male frequency correlated significantly with stand density in two populations in the field and varied nonrandomly between densities in a glasshouse density experiment, strongly suggesting an environmental component to sex determination.
4 In the density experiment, stand density had a strong negative effect on relative allocation to reproduction by both males and cosexes (monoecious individuals). At higher densities, cosexes were quantitatively more female than at lower densities. Also, larger males and cosexes produced more pollen per vegetative biomass than did smaller ones, while allocation to seed production by cosexes increased only proportionally with plant biomass, so that cosexual gender shifted consistently towards greater maleness in larger plants.
5 Males produced between about five and 10 times as much pollen as cosexes, indicating that cosex sex allocation is strongly female-biased. This, and inflorescence architecture, suggest that female-biased cosexuality in M. annua has evolved as a response to selection for facultative self-fertilization in a wind-pollinated species.
6 In M. annua, androdioecy appears to be maintained by a balance between selection for reproductive assurance during colonization, which favours self-fertile cosexuality with female-biased sex allocation, and frequency-dependent selection within populations, favouring increased male allocation and thus allowing the invasion and spread of males.},

abstract = {The widespread coexistence of male and monoecious (cosexual) plants in Spanish, Portuguese and Moroccan populations of Mercurialis annua, an annual wind-pollinated ruderal, represents an important case of functional androdioecy, a rare breeding system in plants and animals. In M. annua, both males and cosexes disperse fully competent pollen. Quantitative gender varies discontinuously between males and cosexes, with males producing a mean of 6.09 times as much pollen as cosexes. It appears that gender is determined by a simple developmental switch, with male and cosexual inflorescences differing markedly in morphology: staminate flowers are borne on erect peduncles in males and in tight spiral clusters around a subsessile pistillate flower in cosexes. Males do not differ from cosexes in their biomass, but they are significantly taller, principally as a result of their greater internode lengths. The cosexual inflorescence is strongly protogynous so that outcrossing is Favoured in dense stands, but seed-set is assured in cosexes isolated from prospective mates because of their ability to self-fertilize. Males typically occur at frequencies of less than about 30% in androdioecious populations, in accordance with theoretical predictions for functional androdioecy. In the genus Mercurialis, dioecy is the ancestral condition and monoecy and androdioecy, which occur in polyploid populations of M. annua, are derived. I argue here that androdioecy is most likely to evolve in plants (1) from dioecy, (2) in wind-pollinated species, and (3) in species with a colonizing habit. These predictions are also consistent with the limited published data available for other species.},

abstract = {Aspects of the serotinous seed banks of Allocasuarina distyla (Vent.) L. Johnson and A. nana (Sieb. ex Spreng.) L. Johnson are presented in relation to fire. A. distyla is single-stemmed and fire-sensitive; A. nana resprouts multiple stems from a lignotuber following fire.
Vegetative above-ground plant growth correlates with seed bank size in A. distyla better than in A. nana. There is approximately 10 times the canopy-stored seed in A. nana 8 years after fire than in A. distyla 9 years after fire. The critical period to initial seed set in A. distyla is between about 7 and 9 years. In A. nana, this period is typically longer but appears to depend on the age of the seed-producing genets.
The age structure of the seed banks in both species remains more or less constant in time, with most seed being young. Seed viability declines in A. distyla from an initial 60% to less than 10% within about 12 years after seed set. A similar pattern appears likely for A. nana, although initial seed viability is about 40%. Attrition in seed viability is attributed to seed predation by insects, fungal attack and seed senescence. The dynamics of seed production and survivorship appear to be similar to those in serotinous proteaceous species studied to date.},
