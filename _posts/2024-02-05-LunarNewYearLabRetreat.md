For this lab retreat, we had the pleasure of celebrating the Lunar New Year! Not everyone was used to celebrating, but everyone enjoyed preparing delicious beef and vegetarian dumplings!

We had the pleasure of discussing science with a discussion led by our new PhD student Suhaas and another with Thomas!
