Today, we celebrate the departure of our esteemed colleague, Esther, a colleague who only stayed with our group for a short time, but who brought the New Zealand spirit to our little team!

Esther has been an invaluable part of our research group over the last few months. Her work in phylogeny, unraveling the evolutionary history of *Veronica* species, and her expertise in botany have been nothing short of exceptional. Throughout her time here, Esther served as a mentor and collaborator, fostering a collaborative environment. She will have given the group a macro-evolutionary point of view, whereas the rest of us are reduced to studying populations!

We bid her farewell with gratitude for her kindness and enthusiasm, and with deep appreciation for the inspiration she has given us. Farewell, Esther, and thank you for your remarkable contributions. We eagerly anticipate the new horizons you will explore and the discoveries you will make. Don't hesitate to follow her on [her personal website](https://estherdale.github.io/)!
