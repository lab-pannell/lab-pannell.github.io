On Wednesday, the whole group went to a small but charming Chinese restaurant near the centre of Lausanne. We celebrated the end of Kai's PhD, which will soon be defended! We also celebrated John getting a new grant which will be used to fund Thomas and Ehouarn's projects. A very good meal, and exciting discussions!
