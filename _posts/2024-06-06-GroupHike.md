Switzerland, famous for its breathtaking landscapes, features a remarkable mix of towering mountains, verdant valleys, and a diverse array of plant life. It serves as a perfect setting for nature lovers and botany experts to explore the rich alpine flora. Taking advantage of this incredible backdrop, the group went for a retreat near Pont de Nant (Vaud), where we were invited to sleep in a traditional chalet. We spent two days there, hiking, eating, chatting and having fun together, interspersed with some very interesting scientific discussions.

The hike was exceptional, a succession of forests, plains, cliffs and incredible Alpine torrents. The excursion was another opportunity for us all to discover the diversity of Swiss botany. With John and Kai, who are experts in Swiss plants and familiar with this terrain, we thoroughly enjoyed identifying various plant species along the route. We often stopped to take in the spectacular views. The Swiss Alps host numerous unique and rare plant species unique to this region.
