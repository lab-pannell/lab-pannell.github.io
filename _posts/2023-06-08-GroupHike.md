Switzerland, renowned for its stunning landscapes, boasts an exceptional combination of majestic peaks, lush valleys, and a diverse range of flora. For nature enthusiasts and botanists alike, the Swiss mountains offer an extraordinary playground to explore the wonders of alpine plant life. Our group welcomed for this hike and to give a seminar José María Fernández-Palacios from Tenerife (Spain). José María Fernández-Palacios, born in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in 1958, is a renowned Ecologist and Professor at the University of La Laguna. He specializes in Island Ecology and Biogeography and leads the university's research group in this field. His diverse research interests also encompass Forest Dynamics, particularly focusing on laurisilva and pine forests, as well as Paleoecology.

The hike we did was fantastic. It commences in Champex-Lac, a ski station in the Commune of Orsières (Valais), nestled in the heart of the Alps. Led by John and Kai, who have been here before and are the leading specialists in Swiss flora of our group, we really enjoyed identifying and explaining the different plant species along the trail. We pause frequently to observe and appreciate the stunning surroundings. The Swiss Alps are home to numerous endemic and rare plant species, some of which are found nowhere else on Earth.

Our most memorable stop takes us to a vibrant meadow filled with wildflowers. The landscape was a breathtaking mosaic of white and yellow hues. The botanists guided us in recognizing each flower and enlighten us about their remarkable adaptations to survive in the harsh alpine environment. We learned about Alpine gentians and buttercups that thrive in this challenging but enchanting habitat.
