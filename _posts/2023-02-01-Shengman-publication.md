Exciting news from our group as Shengman's article, "Compensatory responses of vital rates attenuate impacts of competition on population growth and promote coexistence" has been published in [Ecology Letters](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.14167). 

He studied how competition affects the growth and coexistence of 14 herbaceous plant species. His experiment found that suppressed growth and seedling establishment were major factors in declining population growth, but other vital rates like survival, flowering, and seed production varied by species and elevation. Compensatory responses to competition were common and reduced niche overlap, stabilizing coexistence. The study emphasizes the significance of demographic processes in regulating plant populations.

Congratulations Shengman!
