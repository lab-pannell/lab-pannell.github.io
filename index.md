# Pannell Lab Overview

Focusing on plant, we study transitions between sexual systems and their implications for 
* mating
* resource allocation
* demography
* evolution of the genome and transcriptome, especially sex chromosomes
using 
* theory
* wet-lab work
* bioinformatics
* fieldwork
See our recent publications for further details of results from these and other projects.
