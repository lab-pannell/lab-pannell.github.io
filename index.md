# Pannell Lab Overview

Current projects in the group are addressing questions concerning transitions between sexual systems and their implications for mating, resource allocation, demography and the evolution of the genome and transcriptome, especially sex chromosomes. Some of these are summarised under the project descriptions below. These projects use a combination of theory, wet-lab work, bioinformatics, and fieldwork. See our recent publications for further details of results from these and other projects.
