            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p style="color:#5b8059">"There are several groups of plants in which all the species are di≈ìcious, and
              these exhibit no
              rudiments in the one sex of the organs proper to the other. About the origin of such plants nothing is
              known."</p>
          </div>
          <p> This quote by Charles Darwin from his book "The Different Forms Of The Same Species" (1877) is
            surprisingly still relevant today.
            Why dioecy in plants is rare and why species that are dioecious are so are questions that have not yet been
            fully resolved. </p>
          <p> In the wake of these old questions, the group is particularly focused on addressing questions concerning
            transitions between sexual systems, and their implications for mating, resource allocation, demography and
            the evolution of the genome and transcriptome, especially sex chromosomes. Some of these are summarised
            under the project descriptions below. These projects use a combination of theory, wet-lab work,
            bioinformatics, and fieldwork. See our recent publications for further details of results from these
            and other projects.

          <h4>PLANT BIOLOGY</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The diversity of sexual systems found in plants is tremendous,
            making them a perfect model to study the evolution and ecology of sex. Additionally, the
            accessibility and manipulation of plant reproductive organs make them an ideal study system for
            understanding
            the mechanisms underlying reproduction. Furthermore, plants play a crucial role in many ecosystems, and
            understanding
            their reproductive systems can help us to better understand these ecosystems. Overall, the study of plant
            reproductive systems offers a unique opportunity to gain insights into the diversity and complexity of
            reproductive
            strategies in the living world.</p>

          <h4>EXPERIMENTATION</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">In our lab, experimentation is a key tool that we use to study the
            reproductive systems of plants.
            Experimentation allows us to test specific hypotheses and understand the underlying mechanisms of the
            reproductive systems.
            This allows us to make causal inferences about the role of specific genes, hormones, or
            environmental factors in the reproductive process. Experimentation also allows us to test the limits of
            plant reproductive
            systems by manipulating environmental conditions and studying the response. This can provide insight into
            the adaptability
            of different plant species and the range of conditions under which they can reproduce successfully.

          <h4>THEORY</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Theory plays a critical role in guiding and interpreting our experimental
            work on the reproductive systems of plants. Theory helps us to develop a framework for understanding the
            patterns and mechanisms of reproduction and to make predictions about how different factors may affect
            reproductive success.
            One of the major benefits of theory is that it allows us to integrate and synthesize data from different
            sources
            and to generate a comprehensive understanding of the reproductive systems of plants. This can help us to
            identify
            gaps in our knowledge and to prioritize future research directions.

            <p>Our group has a greenhouse to which other groups in the department have access. It allows an
              optimal growth of the plants with a regulated temperature and humidity throughout the year. We
